# Data features: Heat Syndrome Data

This contains data on heat syndrome emergency department visits, and max daily temperature. Data in this repository feed the interface at [real-time heat-related illness](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/key-topics/climatehealth/syndromic/)

## About the data
Tracking heat-related illness (HRI) in near-real time can help provide situational awareness, supplementing the weather forecast as an indicator of public health risk. HRI detected in emergency department syndromic surveillance data are strongly associated with hot weather and highly correlated with daily counts of HRI hospital discharge data. However, HRI counts detected in the ED syndromic surveillance data represent suspected rather than confirmed illness and is useful to track trends. Some records may be counted as cases when they are not HRI, while other HRI cases may go undetected due to differences in hospital coding practices or because of what patients say when they describe what is bothering them.

### Syndromic surveillance
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines surveillance as "the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those responsible for prevention and control." A syndrome is a group of signs (something a health care provider can observe, like a rash, or body temperature) and symptoms (something a patient feels - like pain, or fatigue) that are often associated with a particular disease or condition.

The heat syndrome is identified in surveillance data by looking for diagnostic codes for heat-related illness and by searching chief complaints (descriptions of why patients are at the ED) for words related to heat, such as overheating, sunstroke, and similar terms.

Syndrome data are inherently non-specific and are not based on diagnostic testing. While the NYC syndromic surveillance system captures data on 100% of ED visits in the city (as of 5/1/16), the data are not comprehensive because some residents seek care outside the city. These data are not exact measures and should be used to understand trends, rather than to count cases. In addition, recent data are not final and are subject to change.

### Heat syndrome

The heat syndrome is identified in surveillance data by looking for diagnostic codes for heat-related illness and by searching chief complaints (descriptions of why patients are at the ED) for words related to heat, such as overheating, sunstroke, and similar terms. In 2023, we revised the case definition, including the exclusion keywords, which results in identification of slightly more suspected cases. The revised definition was applied to all years of data available on the portal.

For more information, see the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists' [heat syndrome case definition](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/pdfs/pdfs2/CSTE_Heat_Syndrome_Case_Defi.pdf).

### Daily temperature
The maximum daily temperature is the heat index or temperature, whichever is higher, as recorded by the National Weather Service weather station at La Guardia Airport.
