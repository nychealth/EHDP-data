## Monthly data files
Data in this repository are hourly averaged measurements of PM<sub>2.5</sub> from the New York City Community Air Survey's network of TSI DustTrak sensors.

## Measurements 
The value shown is PM2.5 in micrograms per cubic meter of air (µg/m3). 

ObservationTimeUTC datetime stamp displayed is the beginning of the averaged PM2.5 measurements for the hour (e.g. 2/1/2020  1:00:00 AM (UTC) reflects data collected between 2/1/2020  1:00:00 AM (UTC) and 2/1/2020  1:59:00 AM (UTC)).

External factors can sometimes affect monitor functioning. Data are preliminary and subject to change.

## About the New York City Community Air Survey
The [NYC Community Air Survey](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/key-topics/airquality/nyccas) is the largest ongoing urban air monitoring program of any U.S. City.  NYCCAS, which began collecting data in December 2008, is a collaboration between the Health Department and Queens College of the City University of New York and provides data to:
- Help inform OneNYC, the City’s sustainability plan
- Track changes in air quality over time
- Estimate exposures for health research
- Inform the public about local topics, such as air quality in the time of COVID-19, recent air quality improvements, car-free zones, unique studies conducted in New York City and what NYCCAS monitoring tells us about the city's neighborhoods.
