Cases admitted on or after October 1, 2015, are represented by the ICD, 10th Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes T67, X30, X32. Cases with diagnoses represented by ICD-9-CM code E900.1 (if admitted before October 1, 2015) or ICD-10-CM code W92 (if admitted on or after October 1, 2015) were excluded. Because of the October 1, 2015 change in diagnostic codes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM, changes in numbers and rates over time should be interpreted with caution because they may be in part due to changes in the coding system.","Sources":"New York State Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) Deidentified Hospital Discharge Data; United States Census","DisplayType":"per 100,000","AvailableGeoTypes":["Borough","CD","Citywide"],"TrendNoCompare":null,"AvailableTimePeriodIDs":[312],"VisOptions":[{"Table":[{"GeoType":"Borough","TimePeriodID":[312]},{"GeoType":"CD","TimePeriodID":[312]},{"GeoType":"Citywide","TimePeriodID":[312]}],"Map":[{"GeoType":"Borough","TimePeriodID":[312],"RankReverse":0},{"GeoType":"CD","TimePeriodID":[312],"RankReverse":0}],"Trend":[{"GeoType":"Borough","TimePeriodID":[312]},{"GeoType":"Citywide","TimePeriodID":[312]}],"Links":[{"Measures":[{"MeasureID":null,"SecondaryAxis":null}],"Disparities":0}]}]},{"MeasureID":1405,"MeasureName":"Heat stress: 5-year emergency department visits, Average annual age-adjusted rate","MeasurementType":"Average annual age-adjusted rate","how_calculated":"The number of NYC residents treated in a NYC emergency department (ED) over 5 years during the months of May-September for the effects of heat and light due to weather conditions or undetermined cause. Residents with a diagnosis of excessive heat due to non-environmental conditions were excluded. Data are based on date of visit and include those with a diagnosis of heat-related illness, even if that was not the principal diagnosis. The data also include patients admitted to the hospital after being treated in an emergency department. Counts are summed by 5-year age groups and divided by the population in each age group, using NYC DOHMH intercensal estimates; quotients are multiplied by the proportion of the 2000 US population in each age group. Age-adjusted rate is the sum of the weighted age-specific rates; expressed as cases per 100,000 residents. Notes: The coding system used to represent diagnoses changed in October 2015. Cases occuring before October 1, 2015 are represented by International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 992.0-992.9, E900.0 or E900.9.
