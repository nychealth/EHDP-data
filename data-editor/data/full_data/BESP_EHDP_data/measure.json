Data are based on date of admission and include those who were admitted&nbsp;with a diagnosis of heat-related illness, even if that was not the principal diagnosis.&nbsp;Because ED visits can take place over multiple days, counts are dependent on the date&nbsp;chosen to reference the visit and could differ slightly from those based on date of discharge.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Notes: The coding system used to represent diagnoses changed in October 2015.
