Heat and humidity cause serious illness and death every summer. In fact, more Americans die from heat waves in a typical year than all other natural disasters combined, both in direct mortality from heat stress (hyperthermia, also known as heat stroke) and by way of increases in the rates of deaths from natural causes due to the exacerbation of other medical conditions. While far less common, coastal storms can also have serious consequences, including long-term mental health impacts. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive flooding and damage in New York City, and resulted in at least 44 deaths.<\/p>\n<p>Power outages can also occur during heat waves and coastal storms. Potential health impacts include gastrointestinal illness due to food spoilage, carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of generators, and illness and death among the medically frail due to mechanical equipment failure, and inability to obtain medical care, or extreme exertion (such as having to climb many flights of stairs in high-rise buildings due to elevator outages). Lack of air conditioning or home heat may also result in heat- and cold-related illnesses.<\/p>","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","<p>Health impact text here<\/p>","NA","<p><span>Active Design and the Environment<\/span><br />Active design is a planning approach to create buildings and communities that encourage physical activity and promote health. Bringing active design to neighborhoods, buildings and streets will encourage walking, bicycling, stair climbing and active play &ndash; and ultimately, will improve the health of community residents.<\/p>","<p><span>Air Quality and Sustainability<\/span><br />Particulate matter is a complex mixture of very small solids and droplets suspended in air. Some particles are produced directly by vehicles, power plants and other sources that burn fuel while others are formed in the atmosphere when certain pollutants react with sunlight. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can be inhaled deep into the lungs, and exposure has been linked to breathing problems, reduced lung function and heart disease. <br /><br /> To achieve our goal, New York City is developing strategies to decrease the amount of harmful air pollutants emitted from a variety of sources within the city, including vehicles, power plants, and buildings, while promoting natural solutions such as planting one million trees. <br /><br /><\/p>","","<span >Falls and the environment<\/span><br>Although falls can occur anywhere, most falls among older adults happen at home. More than one-half of fall-related hospitalizations among older adults were due to falls in the home.  There are many risk factors for falls among older adults including previous falls, gait or balance problems, and use of medications that interact with one another or cause side effects. But physical features of the environment can also put seniors at risk.  Common fall risks hazards in homes include slippery surfaces, inadequate lighting, and tripping hazards, such as clutter, loose rugs, or uneven flooring.  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>","<span >Alcohol and the Environment<\/span><br>Greater alcohol outlet density has been associated with a variety of health and social consequences, including:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Alcohol-related hospitalizations\r\n<li>Violent crime, assault and homicide\r\n<li>Child abuse and intimate partner violence\r\n<li>Liver cirrhosis mortality\r\n<li>Motor vehicle accidents\r\n<\/ul><p>Alcohol advertising &ndash; at point-of-sale and other locations &ndash; permeates the NYC environment. Research suggests that exposing youth to alcohol advertising is associated with increased interest in drinking alcohol. <br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Housing and Health<\/span><br />The home environment influences individual health and safety in a variety of ways. Cracks, holes, plumbing disrepair, peeling paint and other housing maintenance deficiencies are associated with increased likelihood of pest infestations, exposure to lead where lead paint is present, promotion of mold growth and exposure to a variety of additional allergens. Occupants' or landlords' efforts to control these conditions through the use of hazardous chemical products can increase the risk of poisonings in the home. Disrepair also causes injuries, including slips and falls, scalding and electrical shocks.<br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Park Distance<\/span><br /> To be sure that nearly everyone is within a ten minute walk, we are tracking the numbers of New Yorkers who live within both a &frac12; and a &frac14; mile of a park. These distances were chosen because people walk at different speeds. Our goals are to get 99% of New Yorkers within &frac12; mile and 85% of New Yorkers within &frac14; mile of a park.<br /><br /> Access to parks and public space can enrich lives, promote physical and emotional well-being, and provide venues for fitness and peaceful respite. At the launch of PlaNYC in 2007, over two million New Yorkers lived more than a 10 minute walk from a park despite the more than 300 acres of parkland that was added to the city from 2002 to 2007. This shortage of open space threatens our environment, our health and our quality of life. <br /><br /> To encourage access to parks and public space we will target high-impact projects in the neighborhoods with the greatest open space needs. These projects will include community gardens and urban agriculture opportunities, which enrich many of the city&rsquo;s neighborhoods least served by parks. We will also continue to create and renovate parks that will attract people from throughout the city. We will re-conceptualize and green our streets. And because vibrant open spaces both need and support biodiversity, we will increase the health and vitality of natural areas. Finally, we will ensure the long-term health of our open spaces and protect the great investments we have made through expanded stewardship and care. <br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span> Drinking Water Quality<\/span><br />If the NYC water network is properly maintained and operated, then we expect it to deliver consistently clean and potable water throughout the city. To ensure that our water supply is potable, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) collects approximately 15,000 drinking water samples and performs approximately 200,000 analyses of water quality annually. We are tracking the percentage of samples that are below all of the 227 different New York State maximum contaminant levels (MCL), which are the highest levels allowed in city drinking water. The NYS MCLs are more stringent than federal levels. New York City is fortunate to have access to drinking water that has consistently met state and federal drinking water standards. <br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Air Pollution and Health<\/span><br />Fine particulate matter can be inhaled deep into the lungs. Exposure to particulate matter has been linked to breathing problems, reduced lung function and heart disease. Ozone can lead to acute respiratory problems, and it can worsen asthma.&nbsp; The health risks of exposure to these pollutants are greater in certain populations, including older adults, children and people with existing heart or lung diseases.<a><br /><br /><\/a><\/p>","<p><span>Modal Shift<\/span><br />We are tracking the extent to which people are using non-automobile modes of transit including public transportation (e.g., bus, subway), bicycling and walking. These alternative modes, which use less land and create less pollution than automobiles, result in less congestion and increased mobility for NYC residents.<br /><br />To quantify the extent of the modal shift in NYC, we measure the way people travel to the central business district (Manhattan below 60th street) as well as the way people travel citywide. For travel to the central business district, we look directly at changes in the percent of all trips that use non-automobile modes of transit. <br /><br />To track the switch to mass transit citywide we look at the relative growth of auto and transit travel demand. Travel demand is highly correlated to economic activity - during recessions, it tends to go down and during periods of economic growth, it increases. To control for this economic impact, we measure the relative changes in use of transit (including non-motorized travel) and automobiles from the year 2000. <br /><br />Our goal is to increase the mass transit and non-motorized share of travel in NYC, both to the central business district and citywide. <br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Restaurant Food Safety and Health<\/span><br />Safe food handling can protect diners from foodborne illness. During inspections, health inspectors look to ensure that restaurants and their employees are maintaining proper food safety practices. They measure food temperature; look for evidence of food contamination; check for roaches and other vermin; and examine a restaurant's cooking, refrigeration, and cleaning equipment. If the inspector finds violations, she marks points on her inspection checklist. More points mean a lower grade. If conditions are so bad that they pose a public health hazard, the Health Department may close the restaurant until they are fixed.<br /><br /><\/p>","NA","NA","<p><span>Cleaner Energy<\/span><br />To determine whether energy in NYC is getting cleaner, we track the carbon intensity of our electricity supply using a measure called an emissions coefficient. This measure is the number of pounds of emissions - normalized in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) - divided by electricity use in megawatt hours. New York City is striving to lower its emissions coefficient by generating more electricity from cleaner fuels or renewable sources, improving the efficiency of its power plants, and upgrading its distribution network, so that less energy is wasted through grid loss. <br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Climate and Health<\/span><br />Even without long term changes in climate, New Yorkers face weather-related risks today. Heat and humidity cause serious illness and death every summer. In fact, more Americans die from heat waves in a typical year than all other natural disasters combined, both in direct mortality from heat stress (hyperthermia, also known as heat stroke) and by way of increases in the usual rates of deaths from natural causes due to the exacerbation of other medical conditions. <br /><br /> While less common, coastal storms also have imparted serious consequences throughout history and in recent years, most notably Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, from their devastating direct costs in over 1,800 lives along the Gulf Coast, to long-term mental health consequences among survivors. In 2011, Tropical Storm Irene caused extensive flooding throughout the Northeast and is estimated to be one of the costliest disasters in U.S. history, though New York City was largely spared. <br /><br /> The health impacts of weather events and climate change may be further compounded by power outages arising during heat waves and coastal storms. Such effects include gastrointestinal illness due to food spoilage, acute carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of generators, and illness and death among the medically frail due to mechanical equipment failure, lack of air conditioning, inability to obtain medical care, or extreme exertion (such as having to climb many flights of stairs due to elevator outages).<\/p>","<p><span>Lead Hazards and Health<\/span><br />People may be exposed to lead by absorbing, breathing or swallowing lead or lead dust. Children with lead poisoning may develop health, learning and behavioral problems. The health effects of lead exposure may persist long after the exposure has stopped and a child's blood lead level (BLL) has declined. Fetal exposure to lead may also result in cognitive and developmental problems.<br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Housing Supply <\/span><br />We are tracking the number of new housing units created since the start of the plan in 2007, as well as the size of the total housing stock, to ensure that the city is meeting the supply portion of its goal. The nearly one million New Yorkers projected to be added to the city's population between 2005 and 2030 will require 314,000 new units of housing.<br /><br /> To track the creation of new units, we look at housing completion data, i.e., the number of newly issued Certificates of Occupancy (including Temporary Certificates of Occupancy). These indicate that a new residential unit is ready for occupancy. Certificates of Occupancy document new units added through new construction, but they do not account for demolition of existing units, units created (or lost) through changes of use (e.g., loft conversions), or subdivisions or mergers of existing units. Thus, it is an incomplete measure of net additions to total housing supply.<br /><br /> To get a greater sense of how supply is changing, we also track the number of existing units of housing stock in NYC from the triennial Housing and Vacancy Survey (HVS). <br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Dissolved Oxygen<\/span><br />Sufficient concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the water column are critical for the respiration of most aquatic life forms, including fish and invertebrates such as crabs, clams, and zooplankton. Dissolved oxygen concentration is, therefore, one of the most universal indicators of overall water quality and the condition of habitats and ecosystems. <br /><br />We report the average levels of dissolved oxygen harbor-wide, from surface and bottom water, on an annual basis. Rising dissolved oxygen levels, and levels above the state standard (5.0 mg/L) indicate a harbor suitable to most aquatic life forms. Since the 1990s, surface and bottom water dissolved oxygen levels have been above New York State standards for fishing and boating (4.0 mg/L) as well as for bathing and other recreational use (5.0 mg/L), and are continuing to improve.<br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Carbon Monoxide and Health<\/span><br />Carbon monoxide exerts its toxic effects by blocking oxygen transport in the body.&nbsp; Breathing in high concentrations of carbon monoxide can cause loss of consciousness, death or permanent neurological injury. <br />&nbsp;<br />Symptoms of mild carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness and disorientation.<br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Mice, Rats and Health <\/span><br />The presence of rats in communities has been historically associated with a variety of infectious diseases. Today, rats are principally recognized for their contribution to neighborhood stress, poor quality of life, contamination of food, and for their contribution to the destruction of infrastructure. Mice can contaminate food, and their urine and dander are potent allergens, which can exacerbate the symptoms of asthma in sensitive people.&nbsp; <br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Weight and the Environment<\/span> <br />Neighborhood conditions and resources can encourage or discourage healthy behaviors. The density and types of food retail outlets available in neighborhoods may affect food shopping habits and nutrition choices of residents. Healthy food choices combined with physically active lifestyle support maintenance of an optimal bodyweight and overall good health.<\/p>","<p><span>Drinking Water Quality and Health <\/span><br />Drinking water in NYC is monitored regularly for biological and chemical contaminants, for the purpose of protecting public health and checking compliance with state and federal rules. Monitoring drinking water is important because contamination in a single system could expose many people at once. People can be exposed to contaminants in drinking water not only by drinking the water, but also by eating foods prepared with the water, breathing water droplets or chemicals released from the water while showering, or by absorbing chemicals through their skin while bathing.<br /><br />Drinking water is disinfected to reduce the possibility of illness from microorganisms. Disinfection by-products (DBPs) are chemicals that can form when a disinfectant such as chlorine reacts with naturally occurring organic matter and other substances in the source water. Current research is investigating whether there are health effects from chronic exposure to the by-products of water disinfection.<br /><br />Nitrates are nitrogen-oxygen molecules commonly found in water where nitrogen-based fertilizers are used nearby.&nbsp; Decades ago, it was discovered that infants who were fed formula made with water containing nitrates over 10 mg/L sometimes became seriously ill, due to the interference of nitrate with the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.<br /><br />Arsenic is naturally-occurring in groundwater systems in some parts of the US. It may also enter drinking water systems as a result of past use of arsenic-containing pesticides and wood preservatives. Chronic exposure may increase risk of certain cancers. <br /><br /><\/p>","NA","NA","<p><span>Birth Defects and the Environment<\/span><br />Scientists believe most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors including our genes, behaviors and environment. However, the causes of most birth defects are unknown. The fetus is more sensitive to exposures than an adult and if exposures happen during important periods of development, birth defects may result. Although there has been some research into how environmental exposures might cause birth defects, there is still much more work that needs to be done to understand the relationship of these exposures to birth defects.<br /><br />Known and probable risk factors for birth defects include the following: smoking, use of alcohol and other drugs, poor nutrition and/or health (such as low levels of folic acid, obesity and poorly controlled diabetes), some medicines (prescription &amp; over-the-counter), toxic chemicals (such as lead, paint and paint thinner, gasoline, pesticides, and secondhand smoke), infectious agents (such as rubella and toxoplasmosis) and ionizing radiation (x-rays). <br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Childhood Cancer and the Environment <\/span><br /> The causes of most childhood cancer are unknown. It is especially difficult to identify environmental factors related to childhood cancers because - like adult cancer - they are likely to be the result of a mix of genetic, environmental, and behavioral causes, and not just one factor by itself. Exposures to the parent, the fetus in the womb, or the child after birth may all play a role. Some risk factors that explain a small percentage of cases include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation<\/li>\n<li>Genetic abnormalities and conditions, including Down Syndrome<\/li>\n<li>Exposure to chemotherapy drugs known as alkylating agents<\/li>\n<\/ul>","<span >Divert Solid Waste<\/span><br>Of the city's 13.6 million tons of waste per year, we currently recycle 51% of solid waste (including fill) and send 43% to landfills. The remainder is composted or converted to energy. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWe are working to increase the amount diverted to recycling, composting, and conversion to 75%. Diverting solid waste from landfills to recycling and conversion facilities make use of our waste, creating new materials, nutrient sources, and energy out of our waste products. And while we no longer operate landfills in New York City, the waste we send to distant landfills contributes to environmental problems such as greenhouse gas emissions and potential water contamination. Closer to home, reduced truck trips bound for landfills will improve air quality.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe have characterized the types of solid waste generated from residential sources, which account for 29% of the waste stream, and determined that 35% of that waste is recyclable while 40% of it is compostable. However of the materials that can be recycled, New Yorkers are only recycling 47% of metal, plastic, and glass and 38% of paper, and less than 1% is composted. We are working to characterize the types of solid waste generated from commercial sources, which account for 24% of the waste stream, less easily quantified because it is handled by private waste haulers. Overall, efforts to recycle paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, tires and asphalt millings, and derelict vehicles; and to dispose of or reuse fill or dirt from excavation sites, construction and demolition materials, household hazardous waste, and textiles and furniture should enable us to reach our target of diverting 75% of solid waste from landfills by 2030. <br><br>\r\n","<p><span>Pesticides and Health&nbsp; <\/span><br />Exposure to pesticides can occur from consuming foods or beverages that contain pesticide residues, from direct contact with the skin or eyes, or from breathing air in areas where pesticides are applied. Health effects from exposure to pesticides vary by chemical class. In general, short-term effects on humans from high levels of exposure include damage to the skin and eyes, difficulty breathing, neurological tremors or seizure and, in extreme cases, loss of consciousness and death. Current research is investigating whether chronic exposure to certain pesticides increases risk of some cancers, reproductive and developmental problems and neurodegenerative diseases such as <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Parkinsons_disease\" target=\"_blank\">Parkinson's disease<\/a>.<br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Bed Bugs and Health<\/span><br /> Although bed bugs and their bites are a nuisance, they are not known to spread disease. Other health-related consequences have been noted:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bed bug bites can be very itchy and irritating. Most welts heal in a few days but in unusual cases, the welt may persist for several weeks. An anti-itching ointment can help, but if bites become infected, people should see their doctor.<\/li>\n<li>The anxiety about being bitten can lead to sleeplessness, which can affect well-being. Properly and effectively responding to bed bugs helps to keep anxiety in check.<\/li>\n<li>Some people become so desperate that they use illegal or excessive amounts of pesticides which can lead to poisonings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","NA"," ","<p><span>Cigarette Smoke and Health<\/span><br /> Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disease, and causes illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung disease, and problems during and after pregnancy. In fact, smoking cigarettes kills more New Yorkers each year than AIDS, drugs, homicide, and suicide combined.<br /><br />Non-smokers exposed to cigarette smoke at home or work increase their risk of heart disease by 25-30% and their risk of lung cancer by 20-30%. Infants and young children are especially prone to health problems caused by secondhand smoke (e.g., pneumonia and bronchitis, ear infections, asthma, and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat). Babies exposed to cigarette smoke or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy are at an increased risk for <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Sudden_Infant_Death_Syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)<\/a>.<br /><br />In 2002, NYC enacted its Smoke Free Air Act, which prohibits smoking in all workplaces, including restaurants and bars. The primary intent of this law is to protect workers from exposure to secondhand smoke. In that same year, the Health Department estimated that more people (about 1,000 every year) are killed by secondhand smoke than by homicide. In addition, secondhand smoke causes illness (e.g., ear infections, asthma, and respiratory infections) in more than 40,000 NYC adults and children every year. <br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Childhood Lead Exposure and Health<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Lead is found naturally in the environment but is also found in manufactured products. In the past, it was used in products such as gasoline and paint, ceramic products, caulking and pipes and solder, but its use in these products has been dramatically reduced. In 1960, NYC banned the use of lead-based paint in homes. A national ban came into effect in 1978.&nbsp;Leaded gasoline was phased out beginning in the 1970's. However, lead can still be found in some products and in our environment. People may be exposed to lead by absorbing, breathing or swallowing lead or lead dust. Once it enters the body, lead can become a health hazard. Children are more vulnerable to lead poisoning in the first six years of life, particularly the first three, when the brain grows the fastest, and when critical connections in the brain and nervous system that control thought, learning, hearing, movement, behavior and emotions are formed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Lead paint is the primary cause of childhood lead poisoning in NYC.&nbsp; Other sources include imported foods, spices, toys and cosmetics; water in buildings with older pipes; uncovered soil in play areas; travel to countries where environmental lead is poorly controlled.&nbsp; HHP educates families about things they can do to reduce these exposures and prevent childhood lead poisoning.<\/p>","<p><span>Alcohol and the Environment<\/span><br />Greater alcohol outlet density has been associated with a variety of health and social consequences, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alcohol-related hospitalizations<\/li>\n<li>Violent crime, assault and homicide<\/li>\n<li>Child abuse and intimate partner violence<\/li>\n<li>Liver cirrhosis mortality<\/li>\n<li>Motor vehicle injuries<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Alcohol advertising &ndash; at point-of-sale and other locations &ndash; permeates the NYC environment. Research suggests that exposing youth to alcohol advertising is associated with increased interest in drinking alcohol. <br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Physical Activity and the Environment<\/span><br /> Neighborhood conditions and resources can encourage or discourage healthy behaviors. Aspects of the physical environment - such as the presence of well-maintained green spaces, bicycle paths, walking paths, stairs, exercise facilities and perceived safety - encourage physical activity. Healthy food choices combined with physically active lifestyle support maintenance of an optimal bodyweight and overall good health.<br /><br /><\/p>","NA","<span >Traffic safety and the environment<\/span>Many factors contribute to traffic injuries, including human, vehicle and environmental factors.  The built environment influences traffic injury outcomes by shaping  the actions of road users, which can prevent crashes from happening, as well as mitigating the effects of crashes, when they do happen. Built environment features, such as road design and traffic calming strategies include:  pedestrian islands, signal timing, separated bicycle paths, speed humps and bumps, signage, and more.  Environmental interventions can be tailored for a communitys specific needs to improve traffic safety and reduce traffic injuries. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>","<p><span>About PM2.5, Ozone and Health<\/span><br />Fine particulate matter, also known as (PM2.5), are small airborne particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs. Major sources of PM2.5 include trucks, buses and cars, and the burning of fossil fuel to generate electric power and heat buildings. Exposure to particulate matter has been linked to breathing problems, reduced lung function, heart disease and premature death. Ozone, also called smog, causes irritation and inflammation of the lungs and worsening of asthma. <br /><br /><\/p>","<span >Cockroaches and Health<\/span><br>Besides causing annoyance and stress, roaches are sources of allergens that can trigger asthma symptoms in sensitized individuals. Cockroaches also contaminate food, and may contribute to food borne illnesses.

Factors related to the occurrence of many types of cancer include age, sex, race, family history, smoking, diet, exercise and exposure to certain chemicals. Cancers often take a long time (decades) to develop, so it can be hard to single out a particular exposure as having a definite link to cancer.<br /><br />Environmental exposures that may increase the risk of cancer include asbestos and other inhalable fibers; ionizing radiation and chemicals found in the home, workplace, water, food and air. <br /><br /><\/p>","<span >Sugary Drinks and Health<\/span><br>Obesity is at epidemic proportions in New York City. More than half of New York City adults (58%) are overweight or obese; nearly 40% of New York Citys public school students (K-8) are obese or overweight; and the percentage of adults with diagnosed diabetes is increasing, with nearly 10% of New Yorkers now diagnosed with diabetes.<br><br>","<p><span>Heart Attacks and the Environment<\/span><br />Genetics, lifestyle and environmental factors can all contribute to an increased risk for heart attack.

Most ambient air pollutants originate from fossil fuel (e.g. diesel, gasoline, fuel oil and coal) combustion.<br /><br />Second-hand smoke is the single largest contributor to indoor air pollution. Studies suggest that exposure to second-hand smoke can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis. <br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Asthma and the Environment<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The exact causes of asthma are not known. Researchers think both genetics (family history) and exposure to a host of environmental agents cause someone to develop asthma, often early in life.<\/p>\n<p>Asthma triggers can be found in indoor and outdoor environments. Common indoor triggers include secondhand smoke, dust mites, mold, cockroaches, household pets and strong odors. Common outdoor triggers include exposure to pollen and air pollution such as ozone, particulates and diesel exhaust.<\/p>","<p><span>About Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change<\/span><br /> There is broad consensus within the scientific community that human activity is changing the Earth's climate through increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases - primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) - in the atmosphere. Scientists have predicted that unless greenhouse gas emissions are substantially stemmed by the end of the century, climate change will become irreversible. In NYC, scientists project that 40 to 89 days of the year could be at temperatures of 90 degrees or higher. As a coastal city, New York is vulnerable to the most dramatic effects of global warming: rising sea levels and intensifying storms. We have a special stake in this discussion - but also a unique ability to help shape a solution. The sheer scale of our city means that New York emits nearly 0.25% of the world's total greenhouse gases; becoming more efficient will have a tangible impact. <br /><br /> All of PlaNYC's strategies, including reducing the number of cars, building cleaner and more efficient power plants, and addressing the inefficiencies of our buildings, will contribute to achieving our 30% emissions reduction target. These efforts will build on energy-efficient aspects of the city itself. Our density, reliance on mass transit, and smaller, stacked living spaces mean that New Yorkers produce a fraction of the greenhouse gases compared to the average American. That means the growth of NYC is itself a climate change strategy.<br /><br /> We report GHG emissions in units of metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), which allows emissions of greenhouse gases of different heat trapping potential to be added together, and allows for a direct comparison of different greenhouse gases.<br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Carbon Monoxide and Health<\/span><br />Carbon monoxide exerts its toxic effects by blocking oxygen transport in the body.&nbsp; Breathing high concentrations of carbon monoxide can cause loss of consciousness, permanent neurological injury or death. <br /><br />Symptoms of mild carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness and disorientation.<br /><br /><\/p>","<span >Brownfields in New York City<\/span><br>The NYC Office of Environmental Remediation (OER) was created to help identify brownfields and assist with their cleanup. As part of its efforts, OER has developed a Vacant Property Database (VPD)  to help developers identify vacant commercial and industrial properties that may be available for redevelopment, and to provide basic data on past property usage and environmental features. As of 2011, NYC had between 1500 and 2000 potential brownfields, based on a review of vacant properties, historic filling patterns, and other environmental features in the VPD.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe VPD assesses potential or actual contamination on vacant properties, which are only a fraction of the total property stock in NYC. Thus, new brownfield sites will continue to emerge as buildings reach the end of their use cycle and are rebuilt. Our target is to ultimately reduce the number of brownfields in NYC to zero.<br><br>","<p><span>Birth Outcomes and the Environment<\/span><br />Because many genetic and lifestyle factors influence growth and development of fetuses and babies, it can be difficult for researchers to study the effects of environmental exposures on birth outcomes.

To measure whether NYC has increased capacity, we are tracking the number of transit vehicle revenue miles in the New York metropolitan area. Vehicle revenue miles are miles that transit vehicles (e.g., subway cars, buses) are scheduled or travel while in revenue service. They do not include miles traveled without passengers or when returning to a storage depot. Non-city agencies provide significant transit service to and from the city (e.g., Long Island Rail Road, Metro North Rail Road, New Jersey Transit) so we have included them in our computation.

These data provide estimates - not exact counts - of housing by year of construction and peeling paint status.<br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Housing Affordability <\/span><br />We are tracking housing affordability by looking at two indicators: 1) the number of new units of housing affordable to the typical NYC household, and 2) the vacancy rate of apartments across different rental rates.<br /><br /> To calculate the first indicator, we look at the total number of housing units for rent, and then what percentage of those units would be affordable to a household earning the median income in that year. For example, in 2008, the median income of a household in NYC was $45,000 according to the HVS, which translates to affordable monthly housing costs of no more than $1,125 (30% of the monthly gross income for that household). This indicator tells us about the changing cost of housing, and how changes in income relate to the changing cost of housing. If housing was becoming more affordable in NYC, we would expect the amount of housing available to a typical New Yorker to increase. <br /><br /> To calculate the second indicator, we look at the net rental vacancy rates across different price categories. In general, the vacancy rate tells us about the relationship between supply and demand. Vacancy rates below 5% indicate a housing emergency (very low supply and/or very high demand). Typically vacancy rates in NYC are higher for luxury and more expensive apartments while they are lower for less expensive apartments, indicating a relative shortage of adequate inexpensive housing options. PlaNYC seeks to increase the availability of inexpensive housing, which would be indicated by a higher vacancy rate for lower rent market segments. <br /><br /><\/p>","<p><span>Fecal Coliforms<\/span><br />Fecal coliforms are a group of bacteria primarily found in human and animal intestines, and their concentration in water is considered an accurate indication of sewage-related pollution. Though most fecal coliform bacteria do not cause disease, their concentrations are a good indicator of the presence of pathogenic (disease-producing) bacteria.<br /><br />Since the 1990s, harbor-wide surface water fecal coliform levels have been below the state standard for fishing and boating (monthly geometric mean less than or equal to 2,000 cells/100mL from 5 or more samples), as well as the state standard for bathing and other recreational use (monthly geometric mean less than or equal to 200 cells/100mL from 5 or more samples).

In the '70s and '80s, the dire financial situation led to decisions to defer bridge maintenance, which in turn led to declining conditions. Today, we apply lifecycle analyses to make strategic investments in maintenance and component replacement. The approach has yielded better bridge conditions and longer life expectancy for some bridges, which will both save NYC money in the long run and provide the highest safety and service for our customers. The NYC Department of Transportation (NYC DOT) has spent $3 billion in capital construction on city bridges since 2000. With stepped up maintenance, it has led to the near elimination of bridges in \"poor\" condition and an increase in bridges rated \"good\" or \"very good.\" The NYC DOT goal under this program is to have all of its bridges rated in very good, good or fair condition and none rated poor. Bridges in fair condition (or better) receive routine maintenance and component replacement. As they approach the low end of fair, bridges are reconstructed or rehabilitated. This is the most cost-effective approach for the long-term maintenance of city bridges.<br /><br />NYC DOT also tracks the road network on a bi-annual basis. Street conditions are assessed on a scale of 1-10. Ratings of 7 or above indicate good condition, while ratings below 7 qualify a street for resurfacing or reconstruction. A certain number of streets will also be below 7 because of utility work or other issues unrelated to the road itself. The goal is to have at least 85% of city streets rated at or above 7, which assumes that the remaining 15% can be scheduled for resurfacing within the next two years. This translates to about 1,050 lane miles resurfaced each year.<br /><br /><\/p>","NA","NA","NA","<p><span>Energy Efficiency<\/span><br />To track energy efficiency in NYC, we measure energy use across all buildings in NYC and divide by the NYC population.

The law applies to apartments if the following three conditions are met: 1) the building was built before 1960 (or between 1960 and 1978 if the owner knows the building has lead paint); 2) the building has three or more apartments; and 3) a child under six years old lives in the apartment.<\/li>\n<li>If you are a tenant and live in a building covered by Local Law 1, fill out and return the Annual Notice from your landlord asking if a child under six years old lives with you. If you don't get the Annual Notice, call 311.

Health care providers should also test other children who may be at risk, and annually assess children from six months to six years of age for lead exposure risk.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","<p><span>Housing Sustainability<\/span><br /> We are looking at both access to transit (for work and non-work trips) as well as energy usage to track whether NYC is meeting the sustainability portion of our housing goals.<br /><br /> For the transit criteria, we look at the percentage of new building permits issued for residential units that are located within a 1/2 mile of a transit node (e.g. subway stop, commuter rail station). Access to transit options will enable future New Yorkers to live more sustainably. At the inception of PlaNYC, 69% of building permits issued for residential units in the city were within a &frac12; mile of transit, and our aim is to increase this amount. Reaching this goal is facilitated by the NYC zoning strategy, which up-zones areas close to transit to allow additional density. Meanwhile, areas far from transit are down-zoned, which has the simultaneous impact of preserving the character of those neighborhoods. The number of permits issued should not, however, be equated with housing completion data.<br /><br /> We measure the energy used per capita by NYC residential buildings to track the energy intensity of our housing stock from year to year. We expect residential energy usage, and per capita GHG emissions, to fall as the effects of the Greener Greater Buildings Bill (passed December 2009) and other actions take effect.<br /><br /><\/p>","NA","<p><span>Prevention<\/span><br />To help prevent carbon monoxide poisoning: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Residential property owners are required by NYC law to install and maintain smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.

New York City (NYC) faces public health risks from extreme weather events such as heat waves and coastal storms. With climate change, the severity of some of these risks will increase. A 2013 New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) report predicts that by the 2020s, average summer temperatures in New York City will increase by 2.0&deg;F to 3.0&deg;F compared to a 1971-2000 baseline. Heat waves will become more frequent, intense, and longer in duration. Rainfall and precipitation are expected to increase, together with another 4-8 inches of sea level rise and increased probability of coastal storms with flooding (NPCC, Climate Risk Information, 2013).<\/p>\n<h3>Weather and Health<\/h3>\n<p>Even without long-term changes in climate, New Yorkers face weather-related risks today. Heat and humidity cause serious illness and death every summer. In fact, more Americans die from heat waves in a typical year than all other natural disasters combined, both in direct mortality from heat stress (hyperthermia, also known as heat stroke) and by way of increases in the rates of deaths from natural causes due to the exacerbation of other medical conditions. While far less common, coastal storms can also have serious consequences, including long-term mental health impacts. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive flooding and damage in New York City, and resulted in at least 44 deaths.<\/p>\n<p>Power outages can also occur during heat waves and coastal storms. Potential health impacts include gastrointestinal illness due to food spoilage, carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of generators, and illness and death among the medically frail due to mechanical equipment failure, and inability to obtain medical care, or extreme exertion (such as having to climb many flights of stairs in high-rise buildings due to elevator outages). Lack of air conditioning or home heat may also result in heat- and cold-related illnesses.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>The Tracking Portal provides data on counts and rates of death, hospital admission, and treatment in an emergency department for heat stress. While these cases can be readily identified with hyperthermia listed as a diagnosis or cause of death, it is important to note that they reflect only a portion of the overall health impact of extreme heat. Increases in natural-cause hospitalization and death rates during heat waves (from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and renal disease for example) may be estimated using statistical methods.<\/p>\n<p>The Tracking Portal also provides counts and rates of hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for cold stress. As with heat stress data, is important to note that cold stress data reflect only a portion of the overall health impact, and does not account for potential increases in hospital visits for other conditions that can be exacerbated by cold exposure (such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease for example).<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<p><em>Air conditioning is the most important way to prevent heat stress and death on hot days. &nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those most vulnerable to heat stress include older adults and people with health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental illness, or cognitive impairments.<\/li>\n<li>Set air conditioners to 78&deg;F or low-cool to provide comfort while not wasting energy.<\/li>\n<li>Check on family, friends, and neighbors at-risk and assist them in staying cool and well hydrated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Living without heat or being outdoors in cold weather for a prolonged time can be dangerous. <\/em><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Stay indoors as much as possible.

Interpersonal violence includes child abuse and neglect, youth violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and elder abuse. Violence can involve injury to self, including self-harm, suicide attempts, and death by suicide. Violence can also take the form of power against a group or community.<\/p>\n<p>Violence is a public health issue because it is a cause of morbidity and mortality, leading to physical and emotional harm, an increase in negative health outcomes, premature death, psychological trauma and persistent fear to individuals and communities.<\/p>\n<p>Violence is also an equity issue because it disproportionately affects groups that have been oppressed due to their socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, geographic location, or some combination of these factors. Data from multiple sources illustrate tremendous disparities in the distribution and burden of violence throughout NYC. For instance, rates of firearm-related violence are at least two times higher in high poverty neighborhoods when compared to lower poverty neighborhoods. And, violence persists as a leading cause of premature death among NYC&rsquo;s men of color.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Factors that Contribute to Violence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p>Restricting the explanation of disparities in violence to differences in individuals and group characteristics most affected by the violence only initiates bias and constrains problem-solving<em>.<\/em> To understand what drives violence, it is important to look at the context and systems within which it occurs and consider the negative impact that historic practices (e.g., redlining) and ongoing social structures (e.g., institutional racism) have on particular groups and communities.<\/p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5004736/\" target=\"_blank\">racialized systems have created and upheld stereotypes that link Black men and criminality<\/a>, while ignoring the imbalanced distribution of power and resources experienced by Black men and Black communities. A myriad of &nbsp;social, political, economic, historical, and environmental factors contribute to violence. These factors convey messages about which populations and communities are deprived of society&rsquo;s resources and which are privileged by them. Some of these factors include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poverty and neighborhood disinvestment<\/li>\n<li>Housing and historic redlining practices<\/li>\n<li>Education and employment opportunities<\/li>\n<li>Policing and incarceration practices<\/li>\n<li>Chronic stress and intergenerational trauma Community and social norms<\/li>\n<li>Access to health and health care<\/li>\n<li>Built environment<\/li>\n<li>Racism and other forms of oppression<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Examining factors like these that disproportionately marginalize certain populations illuminate opportunities for prevention.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>Violence is frequently described through homicide statistics.&nbsp;While it is a leading cause of death and captures the most severe form of violence, non-fatal violence-related injuries are much more common and help paint the larger picture on the burden of violence and its impact on the health and future of individuals, families, and communities.<\/p>\n<h3>Interpreting the Data and Informing Solutions<\/h3>\n<p>Violence-related data must be interpreted in ways where we move beyond demonizing those causing the harm and instead look at the context and systems that gives rise to violence. Interpreting data this way illuminates ways to mitigate the social, political, economic, historical, and environmental factors that contribute to violence.<\/p>\n<p>With any public health epidemic, be it influenza, obesity, opioid addiction or gun violence, prevention is key.&nbsp; Prevention is achievable in ways that are similar to multi-pronged approaches that have been used to address the risk and resilient factors for health outcomes like asthma, motor vehicle crashes, and opioid overdoses. Indeed, multi-faceted approaches to health promotion that empower individuals, families, communities, and systems equitably are where sustainable solutions for violence reduction and prevention reside.<\/p>","<h3>About Healthy Eating<\/h3><p>Healthy eating is associated with better health, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. That means that having access to healthy, safe, and affordable food choices is crucial for a person to achieve healthy eating habits.<\/p><p>Food access is influenced by many environmental factors, including proximity to food retail outlets and neighborhood-level resources (like neighborhood poverty, and availability of public transportation).<\/p><p>Sugary drinks contribute to a higher-calorie diet, increased risk of heart disease and diabetes, and long-term weight gain.

Some vectorborne disease agents are maintained primarily through transmission between arthropods and humans (e.g., dengue virus and malaria), while others are maintained between arthropods and animal reservoirs (e.g., Lyme disease and West Nile virus) and humans may become infected incidentally.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Vectorborne Disease and the Environment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Climate is one of many important interacting variables that affect people&rsquo;s risk for vectorborne diseases in New York City. Warmer winters make it easier for ticks to survive in NYC year-round, while a longer warm season increases the length of time that ticks are active each year. Warming temperatures can lengthen the season in which mosquitoes are out and biting, and accelerate the mosquito life cycle. This can mean more frequent contact between mosquitoes and their hosts, which can facilitate the spread of diseases.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;Changing precipitation patterns, with longer periods between rains but heavier rain events, may affect the amount of standing water that mosquitoes have to breed in. Climate change may also alter bird migration patterns or result in changes in deer and small mammal populations that serve as hosts for vectorborne diseases.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","<h3>About Active Design<\/h3>\n<p>Physical inactivity and unhealthy diet rank among the leading risk factors for premature death in the United States.

Some particles are produced directly by vehicles, power plants and other sources that burn fuel while others are formed in the atmosphere when certain pollutants react with sunlight. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can be inhaled deep into the lungs, and exposure has been linked to breathing problems, reduced lung function and heart disease. <br /><br /> To achieve our goal, New York City is developing strategies to decrease the amount of harmful air pollutants emitted from a variety of sources within the city, including vehicles, power plants, and buildings, while promoting natural solutions such as planting one million trees.<\/p>\n<h3>City Ranking<\/h3>\n<p>The Large City Air Quality Ranking indicator compares levels of PM2.5 in NYC to levels in Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and San Diego.

Among New York City's older adults, there are approximately 30,500 emergency department (ED) visits, 16,600 hospitalizations, and 300 deaths each year. Falls are not a normal part of aging, and research shows that many falls can be prevented.<\/p>\n<h3>Falls and the environment<\/h3>\n<p>Although falls can occur anywhere, falls among older adults frequently happen at home. More than one-half of fall-related hospitalizations among older adults were due to falls in the home. There are many risk factors for falls among older adults including previous falls, gait or balance problems, and use of multiple medications that interact with one another or cause side effects. Physical features of the environment can also put seniors at risk. Common fall risks hazards in homes include slippery surfaces, inadequate lighting, and tripping hazards, such as clutter, loose rugs, or uneven flooring.<\/p>\n<h3>About the data and indicators<\/h3>\n<p>Falls indicators presented on this site are derived from administrative emergency department (ED) and hospitalization billing records from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS). Fall-related ED visits and hospitalizations are identified using diagnostic codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, Clinical Modification, as defined by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s external cause-of-injury matrix and using diagnostic information from any diagnosis field. Place of injury codes for these ED visits and hospitalizations allow for identification of falls that have occurred in the home. Data are based on address of the patient, not the address where the fall occurred.&nbsp; Only falls resulting in outcomes severe enough to require treatment in the hospital ED or an inpatient stay are included; falls resulting in no health outcomes or outcomes treated outside of a NYC hospital are not captured. ED visit counts include treated and released visits, and hospitalization counts include only live discharges. ED visits and hospitalizations include NYC residents aged 65 years and older discharged from a NYC hospital.<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>To help prevent falls, older adults should:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stay physically active to strengthen muscles and improve balance<\/li>\n<li>Remove slip and trip hazards in the home, such as throw rugs, electrical cords or other clutter<\/li>\n<li>Improve lighting in and around the home<\/li>\n<li>Ask building owner, landlord, or super to make all necessary home repairs, and install grab bars in the shower and near the toilet<\/li>\n<li>Ask doctor, nurse, and/or pharmacist to review all medicines<\/li>\n<li>Talk with doctors about previous falls and prevention strategies<\/li>\n<\/ul>","<h3>About Alcohol<\/h3>\n<p>Heavy regular drinking and binge drinking contribute to a wide range of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, cirrhosis, depression and dementia. Alcohol use is also associated with suicide, homicide, domestic violence, sexually transmitted diseases and injuries. It is one of the leading behavior-related causes of death in New York City (NYC).<\/p>\n<p>This site provides data on heavy alcohol consumption and alcohol outlets in NYC.<\/p>\n<h3>Alcohol and the Environment<br />Greater alcohol outlet density has been associated with a variety of health and social consequences, including:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Alcohol-related hospitalizations<\/li>\n<li>Violent crime, assault and homicide<\/li>\n<li>Child abuse and intimate partner violence<\/li>\n<li>Liver cirrhosis mortality<\/li>\n<li>Motor vehicle accidents<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Alcohol advertising &ndash; at point-of-sale and other locations &ndash; permeates the NYC environment. Research suggests that exposing youth to alcohol advertising is associated with increased interest in drinking alcohol. <br /><br /><\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<br />Alcohol drinking is measured in the NYC Health Department&rsquo;s Community Health Surveys. We define heavy drinking as an average of more than two drinks per day for men or more than one drink per day for women. We define binge drinking as five or more drinks on one occasion, and as of 2011, four or more drinks for women. The accuracy of estimates derived from surveys depends in part on participants&rsquo; ability to recall and honestly report their behavior.<br /><br />Alcohol outlets data are provided by the New York State Liquor Authority, which licenses establishment to sell alcoholic beverages. Establishments are categorized as service or retail. Service outlets are defined as locations where the patron purchases and consumes the alcohol in the same place (on-premise), such as a bar or restaurant. Retail outlets are defined as locations where the patron purchases the alcohol on-site such as at a grocery or liquor store but must consume the alcohol elsewhere (off-premise). <br /><br /><\/h3>\n<h3>Prevention<br />Policies and practices that have been shown to reduce harmful drinking include:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Enforcing laws prohibiting sales of alcohol to youth and to those already intoxicated.<\/li>\n<li>Limiting the density of alcohol outlets.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Industry can help to control hazardous drinking behavior by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limiting the use of drink specials or promotions.<\/li>\n<li>Using standard measures for drinks.<\/li>\n<li>Maintaining a limit on the number or drinks a person can consume.<\/li>\n<li>Providing training and education to employees to encourage responsible alcohol sales and consumption.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Health care providers should incorporate universal screening for alcohol problems into medical care settings.<\/p>","<h3>About Housing Quality<\/h3>\n<p>No family should have to choose between affordable and healthy housing.<strong> All tenants are entitled to safe, decent and sanitary housing, which prevents disease and injury.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In New York City, substandard or poor housing tends to cluster in neighborhoods.

These distances were chosen because people walk at different speeds. Our goals are to get 99% of New Yorkers within &frac12; mile and 85% of New Yorkers within &frac14; mile of a park.<br /><br /> Access to parks and public space can enrich lives, promote physical and emotional well-being, and provide venues for fitness and peaceful respite. At the launch of PlaNYC in 2007, over two million New Yorkers lived more than a 10 minute walk from a park despite the more than 300 acres of parkland that was added to the city from 2002 to 2007. This shortage of open space threatens our environment, our health and our quality of life. <br /><br /> To encourage access to parks and public space we will target high-impact projects in the neighborhoods with the greatest open space needs. These projects will include community gardens and urban agriculture opportunities, which enrich many of the city&rsquo;s neighborhoods least served by parks. We will also continue to create and renovate parks that will attract people from throughout the city. We will re-conceptualize and green our streets. And because vibrant open spaces both need and support biodiversity, we will increase the health and vitality of natural areas. Finally, we will ensure the long-term health of our open spaces and protect the great investments we have made through expanded stewardship and care.<\/p>","<h3 id=\"descriptiontitle\">Water Supply<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/html/onenyc/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">OneNYC<\/a> is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York City's future.<\/p>\n<p>Goal: Ensure the high quality and reliability of our water supply system.<\/p>\n<h3>Drinking Water Quality<\/h3>\n<p>If the NYC water network is properly maintained and operated, then we expect it to deliver consistently clean and potable water throughout the city. To ensure that our water supply is potable, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) collects approximately 15,000 drinking water samples and performs approximately 200,000 analyses of water quality annually. We are tracking the percentage of samples that are below all of the 227 different New York State maximum contaminant levels (MCL), which are the highest levels allowed in city drinking water. The NYS MCLs are more stringent than federal levels. New York City is fortunate to have access to drinking water that has consistently met state and federal drinking water standards.<\/p>\n<h3>Drinking Water Demand<\/h3>\n<p>New York City will be better able to meet its need for water if there is less demand on the water network. For this reason, decreasing city water use is a critical component to ensuring long-term water reliability. We are assessing progress toward our goal by measuring the amount of water used annually (using the average daily diversion to in-city supply), divided by the annual estimated NYC population.<\/p>","<h3>About Air Pollution<\/h3>\n<p>Air quality is a <strong>measure of the condition of the air around us<\/strong>.

These alternative modes, which use less land and create less pollution than automobiles, result in less congestion and increased mobility for NYC residents.<br /><br />To quantify the extent of the modal shift in NYC, we measure the way people travel to the central business district (Manhattan below 60th street) as well as the way people travel citywide. For travel to the central business district, we look directly at changes in the percent of all trips that use non-automobile modes of transit. <br /><br />To track the switch to mass transit citywide we look at the relative growth of auto and transit travel demand. Travel demand is highly correlated to economic activity - during recessions, it tends to go down and during periods of economic growth, it increases. To control for this economic impact, we measure the relative changes in use of transit (including non-motorized travel) and automobiles from the year 2000. <br /><br />Our goal is to increase the mass transit and non-motorized share of travel in NYC, both to the central business district and citywide.<\/p>\n<h3>Transit Capacity<\/h3>\n<p>Increasing transit capacity will reduce traffic congestion by allowing more people to take mass transit. To measure whether NYC has increased capacity, we are tracking the number of transit vehicle revenue miles in the New York metropolitan area. Vehicle revenue miles are miles that transit vehicles (e.g., subway cars, buses) are scheduled or travel while in revenue service. They do not include miles traveled without passengers or when returning to a storage depot. Non-city agencies provide significant transit service to and from the city (e.g., Long Island Rail Road, Metro North Rail Road, New Jersey Transit) so we have included them in our computation. We have also included all modes of mass transit (e.g., bus, tram, ferry, rail, subway paratransit vehicles) to ensure a complete view of transit capacity.<\/p>\n<h3>State of Good Repair - Bridges and Roads<\/h3>\n<p>NYC owns and maintains 786 bridges and related structures. In the '70s and '80s, the dire financial situation led to decisions to defer bridge maintenance, which in turn led to declining conditions. Today, we apply lifecycle analyses to make strategic investments in maintenance and component replacement. The approach has yielded better bridge conditions and longer life expectancy for some bridges, which will both save NYC money in the long run and provide the highest safety and service for our customers. The NYC Department of Transportation (NYC DOT) has spent $3 billion in capital construction on city bridges since 2000. With stepped up maintenance, it has led to the near elimination of bridges in \"poor\" condition and an increase in bridges rated \"good\" or \"very good.\" The NYC DOT goal under this program is to have all of its bridges rated in very good, good or fair condition and none rated poor. Bridges in fair condition (or better) receive routine maintenance and component replacement. As they approach the low end of fair, bridges are reconstructed or rehabilitated. This is the most cost-effective approach for the long-term maintenance of city bridges.<br /><br />NYC DOT also tracks the road network on a bi-annual basis. Street conditions are assessed on a scale of 1-10. Ratings of 7 or above indicate good condition, while ratings below 7 qualify a street for resurfacing or reconstruction. A certain number of streets will also be below 7 because of utility work or other issues unrelated to the road itself. The goal is to have at least 85% of city streets rated at or above 7, which assumes that the remaining 15% can be scheduled for resurfacing within the next two years. This translates to about 1,050 lane miles resurfaced each year.<\/p>\n<h3>State of Good Repair - Subway stations<\/h3>\n<p>NYC Transit&rsquo;s 468 passenger stations are used by millions of customers each day. The system has 277 underground stations, 142 on elevated structures, and 49 on viaduct, embankment, or open-cut structures. In 2008, NYC Transit completed a comprehensive condition survey of all stations conducted by independent engineering consultants. Over 14,500 components were rated on a scale of 1 (best) to 5 (worst) to identify structural and architectural defects. Components rated 3.0 or worse are identified as needing repair. Transit&rsquo;s goal is to eliminate the most deficient conditions throughout the system within 15 years through a program of comprehensive and targeted component-based station projects, combined with coordinated maintenance strategies. These investments will target components such as stairs and platform edges that most affect safety and the customer experience. Investment in stations will be guided by an ongoing Condition Assessment Inspection Program and reevaluation of implementation approaches to improve efficiency and effectiveness of investments to benefit customers.<\/p>","<h3>About Restaurant Food Safety<\/h3>\n<p>New York City has approximately 24,000 restaurants that the Health Department inspects every year to monitor compliance with city and state food safety regulations. At the end of an inspection, the Health Department gives restaurants a score, which is eventually converted to a grade of A, B or C. This site describes the distribution of A grades across New York City restaurants.<\/p>\n<h3>Restaurant Food Safety and Health<\/h3>\n<p>Safe food handling can protect diners from foodborne illness. During inspections, health inspectors look to ensure that restaurants and their employees are maintaining proper food safety practices. They measure food temperature; look for evidence of food contamination; check for roaches and other vermin; and examine a restaurant's cooking, refrigeration, and cleaning equipment. If the inspector finds violations, she marks points on her inspection checklist. More points mean a lower grade. If conditions are so bad that they pose a public health hazard, the Health Department may close the restaurant until they are fixed.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>The NYC Health Department began issuing grades and requiring restaurants to post them in July 2010.

To measure progress, we are tracking how our buildings are becoming more energy efficient as well as the extent to which our energy is becoming cleaner and more reliable.<\/p>\n<h3>Cleaner Energy<\/h3>\n<p>To determine whether energy in NYC is getting cleaner, we track the carbon intensity of our electricity supply using a measure called an emissions coefficient. This measure is the number of pounds of emissions - normalized in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) - divided by electricity use in megawatt hours. New York City is striving to lower its emissions coefficient by generating more electricity from cleaner fuels or renewable sources, improving the efficiency of its power plants, and upgrading its distribution network, so that less energy is wasted through grid loss.<\/p>\n<h3>Reliable Energy<\/h3>\n<p>To track the reliability of our electricity supply, we look at the state of repair of the infrastructure itself.<br /><br />To measure whether the infrastructure is in a state of good repair, we use a System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), which measures the average number of power outages per 1000 customers.<\/p>\n<h3>Energy Efficiency<\/h3>\n<p>To track energy efficiency in NYC, we measure energy use across all buildings in NYC and divide by the NYC population. To separate the impact of improvements in energy efficiency from changes in weather - which inevitably impact energy use - we take a three year rolling average. New York City is working on ways to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, and to lower our per capita use of energy.<\/p>","<p><h3  id=\"descriptiontitle\">About Climate and Weather<\/h3 ><\/p>\n<p>A region's climate is characterized by its usual weather conditions, seasons, and patterns in extreme weather events like heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes.<\/p>\n<p>The world&rsquo;s climate is shifting, becoming warmer with more precipitation and weather extremes. Over the past century in New York City, average temperatures have increased by 0.25&deg;F per decade, precipitation by 0.72 inches per decade, and sea levels by 1.2 inches per decade. By the 2020s, a projected 25-30 days above 90&deg;F are expected in a typical summer, resulting in more frequent and intense heat waves. Rainfall and precipitation are expected to increase by up to 5%, together with another 10 inches of sea level rise and increased probability of coastal storms with flooding (NYC Panel on Climate Change, Climate Risk Information, 2009).<\/p><p><h3 >Climate and Health<\/h3 ><br />Even without long term changes in climate, New Yorkers face weather-related risks today. Heat and humidity cause serious illness and death every summer. In fact, more Americans die from heat waves in a typical year than all other natural disasters combined, both in direct mortality from heat stress (hyperthermia, also known as heat stroke) and by way of increases in the usual rates of deaths from natural causes due to the exacerbation of other medical conditions. <br /><br /> While less common, coastal storms also have imparted serious consequences throughout history and in recent years, most notably Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, from their devastating direct costs in over 1,800 lives along the Gulf Coast, to long-term mental health consequences among survivors. In 2011, Tropical Storm Irene caused extensive flooding throughout the Northeast and is estimated to be one of the costliest disasters in U.S. history, though New York City was largely spared. <br /><br /> The health impacts of weather events and climate change may be further compounded by power outages arising during heat waves and coastal storms. Such effects include gastrointestinal illness due to food spoilage, acute carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of generators, and illness and death among the medically frail due to mechanical equipment failure, lack of air conditioning, inability to obtain medical care, or extreme exertion (such as having to climb many flights of stairs due to elevator outages).<\/p><p><h3 >About the Data and Indicators<\/h3 ><br />The Tracking Portal provides data on counts and rates of death, hospital admission, and treatment in an emergency department for heat stress. While these cases can be readily identified with hyperthermia listed as a diagnosis or cause of death, it is important to note that they reflect only a portion of the overall health impact of extreme heat. Increases in natural-cause hospitalization and death rates during heat waves (from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and renal disease for example) may be estimated using statistical methods. <br /><br /><\/p><p><h3 >Prevention<\/h3 ><br />Air conditioning is the most important way to prevent heat stress and death on hot days.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those most vulnerable to heat stress include older adults (&gt;65 years) and people with health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental illness, or other cognitive impairment. Some medications can increase heat risk - talk to your doctor or pharmacist to learn more about medication-related risk and precautions to take during hot weather.<\/li>\n<li>For air conditioners with a thermostat, a setting of 78&deg;F is recommended to provide comfort while not wasting energy.<\/li>\n<li>Check on those at-risk and assist them in staying cool and well hydrated. Seek medical attention immediately if the victim has a rapid heart rate, trouble breathing, is no longer sweating, displays very unusual behavior, or loses consciousness.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Being prepared is key to weathering hurricanes and coastal storms safely.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find out if you live in an evacuation zone, and stay tuned to TV and radio evacuation messages when a storm approaches. Information can be found at www.nyc.gov by searching &ldquo;Hurricane Zones,&rdquo; or by calling 311.<\/li>\n<li>Have a &ldquo;Go Bag&rdquo; ready for evacuation, with copies of IDs and insurance cards, bottled water and non-perishable snacks, a list of medications and dosages, doctors&rsquo; phone numbers, a first aid kit, extra keys, a flashlight and battery operated radio, and small personal or family care items. .<\/li>\n<li>Keep emergency supplies ready at home to shelter in place, if directed: a three-day supply of drinking water and non-perishable foods, first aid kit, flashlight, battery operated radio and extra batteries, whistle, iodine tablets or eyedropper and plain bleach (for disinfecting water if directed), and a battery-operated phone.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p><h3 >Key Messages<\/h3 ><br />About 80% of heat stroke victims in New York City are overcome by excessively hot conditions in their own homes, as indoor temperatures in the urban environment may be even hotter than outdoor temperatures when an air conditioner is not available or not in use.<\/p>\n<p>While heat-related mortality rates are overall substantially lower than in historical periods before electricity and air conditioning (a notorious heat wave in 1896 killed approximately 1,500 NYC residents), we may begin to see a reversal in this trend as a result of rising temperatures, depending on the extent of adaptation. In 2011, a Health Department survey estimated that 25% of New York City adults still do not have or rarely use air conditioning during hot summer weather, many of whom are at increased risk of heat stress due to age or poor health.<\/p>","<h3>About Lead Hazards<\/h3>\n<p>The main source of childhood lead poisoning in NYC, as in most of the United States, is lead-based paint in older, deteriorated housing. Nationwide, lead poisoning is associated with housing constructed before 1950, when lead-based paint was widely used and contained more lead than in later decades. In 1960, NYC banned the use of lead-based paint in homes and a national ban went into effect in 1978. Older layers of lead paint may still be present in older buildings and can become a lead hazard when the paint chips, peels or is abraded, or when renovations or repairs are conducted without taking appropriate actions to control dust. Families residing in older, poorly maintained housing are at higher risk for lead poisoning.<\/p>\n<p>Dust from lead-based paint can contaminate floors and windowsills, and children's hands, and toys. Young children who crawl on the floor and put their hands and toys in their mouths are at greatest risk for lead poisoning through swallowing lead dust.<\/p>\n<p>Lead from sources other than paint may also present a hazard to children. Information on other sources of lead poisoning can be found on the Health Department's website at: <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/lead-poisoning-children-and-lead-poisoning.page\" target=\"_blank\">http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/lead-poisoning-children-and-lead-poisoning.page<\/a><a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/environmental/lead-homepage.shtml\" target=\"_blank\"><br /><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Lead Hazards and Health<\/h3>\n<p>People may be exposed to lead by absorbing, breathing or swallowing lead or lead dust. Children with lead poisoning may develop health, learning and behavioral problems. The health effects of lead exposure may persist long after the exposure has stopped and a child's blood lead level (BLL) has declined. Fetal exposure to lead may also result in cognitive and developmental problems.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>The indicators in this section focus on lead paint hazards, because these are the most common sources of lead poisoning for NYC children. Data on children exposed to lead can be found under the topic \"Health Outcomes and Human Exposures\" on this portal. <br /><br />Indicators are based on data from the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/housing/nychvs/\" target=\"_blank\">Housing and Vacancy Survey<\/a> and the US Census 2000. These data provide estimates - not exact counts - of housing by year of construction and peeling paint status.<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<h3>To prevent exposure to lead, landlords, tenants and parents can do the following:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In NYC, <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/Lead-Based-Paint.page\" target=\"_blank\">Local Law 1<\/a> requires landlords to inspect and fix lead paint hazards at no cost to tenants. The law applies to apartments if the following three conditions are met: 1) the building was built before 1960 (or between 1960 and 1978 if the owner knows the building has lead paint); 2) the building has three or more apartments; and 3) a child under six years old lives in the apartment.<\/li>\n<li>If you are a tenant and live in a building covered by Local Law 1, fill out and return the Annual Notice from your landlord asking if a child under six years old lives with you. If you don't get the Annual Notice, call 311. If you have a new baby, or a child under six years old comes to live with you, tell your landlord in writing.<\/li>\n<li>Call 311 if your landlord does not fix peeling paint, or if you think repair work is being done unsafely.<\/li>\n<li>Call 311 if you live in a one- or two-family house with peeling paint and have a child under the age of six. Ask for the Health Department's Lead Poisoning Prevention Program.<\/li>\n<li>Wash floors, window sills, hands, toys and pacifiers often.<\/li>\n<li>Do not use imported foods, spices, clay pots and dishes, medicines, toys and cosmetics that have been found to contain lead.<\/li>\n<li>All children should be tested for lead poisoning at ages one and two. Health care providers should also test other children who may be at risk, and annually assess children from six months to six years of age for lead exposure risk.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>The main source of childhood lead poisoning in NYC, as in most of the United States, is lead-based paint in older, deteriorated housing. Chipping, flaking and peeling paint and paint disturbed during home remodeling contributes to lead dust and contaminates bare soil around a home. Children can be exposed by eating lead-based paint chips, chewing on objects painted with lead-based paint or swallowing house dust or soil that contains lead.<br /><br /> Lead from sources other than paint may also present a hazard to children. Other sources of lead poisoning include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Imported herbal medicines and remedies (e.g., azarcon and greta used for upset stomach, and litargirio used for several purposes)<\/li>\n<li>Painted and glazed clay pots and dishes used for cooking, serving or storing food&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Imported cosmetics (e.g., kohl; surma; kajal)&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Imported candies (e.g., candies made with chili powder; candies wrapped in lead-contaminated paper; candies stored in clay pots)&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Imported toys and jewelry&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Work involving the use of lead (recycling or making automobile batteries, radiator repair)&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Hobbies involving the use of lead (making stained-glass windows, hunting, fishing, target shooting).<\/li>\n<\/ul>","<h3 id=\"descriptiontitle\">Housing and Neighborhoods<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/html/onenyc/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">OneNYC<\/a> is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York City's future.<\/p>\n<p>Goal: Create homes for nearly a million more New Yorkers while making housing and neighborhoods more affordable and sustainable.<\/p>\n<h3>Housing Supply<\/h3>\n<p>We are tracking the number of new housing units created since the start of the plan in 2007, as well as the size of the total housing stock, to ensure that the city is meeting the supply portion of its goal. The nearly one million New Yorkers projected to be added to the city's population between 2005 and 2030 will require 314,000 new units of housing.<br /><br /> To track the creation of new units, we look at housing completion data, i.e., the number of newly issued Certificates of Occupancy (including Temporary Certificates of Occupancy). These indicate that a new residential unit is ready for occupancy. Certificates of Occupancy document new units added through new construction, but they do not account for demolition of existing units, units created (or lost) through changes of use (e.g., loft conversions), or subdivisions or mergers of existing units. Thus, it is an incomplete measure of net additions to total housing supply.<br /><br /> To get a greater sense of how supply is changing, we also track the number of existing units of housing stock in NYC from the triennial Housing and Vacancy Survey (HVS).<\/p>\n<h3>Housing Affordability<\/h3>\n<p>We are tracking housing affordability by looking at two indicators: 1) the number of new units of housing affordable to the typical NYC household, and 2) the vacancy rate of apartments across different rental rates.<br /><br /> To calculate the first indicator, we look at the total number of housing units for rent, and then what percentage of those units would be affordable to a household earning the median income in that year. For example, in 2008, the median income of a household in NYC was $45,000 according to the HVS, which translates to affordable monthly housing costs of no more than $1,125 (30% of the monthly gross income for that household). This indicator tells us about the changing cost of housing, and how changes in income relate to the changing cost of housing. If housing was becoming more affordable in NYC, we would expect the amount of housing available to a typical New Yorker to increase. <br /><br /> To calculate the second indicator, we look at the net rental vacancy rates across different price categories. In general, the vacancy rate tells us about the relationship between supply and demand. Vacancy rates below 5% indicate a housing emergency (very low supply and/or very high demand). Typically vacancy rates in NYC are higher for luxury and more expensive apartments while they are lower for less expensive apartments, indicating a relative shortage of adequate inexpensive housing options. PlaNYC seeks to increase the availability of inexpensive housing, which would be indicated by a higher vacancy rate for lower rent market segments.<\/p>\n<h3>Housing Sustainability<\/h3>\n<p>We are looking at both access to transit (for work and non-work trips) as well as energy usage to track whether NYC is meeting the sustainability portion of our housing goals.<br /><br /> For the transit criteria, we look at the percentage of new building permits issued for residential units that are located within a 1/2 mile of a transit node (e.g. subway stop, commuter rail station). Access to transit options will enable future New Yorkers to live more sustainably. At the inception of PlaNYC, 69% of building permits issued for residential units in the city were within a &frac12; mile of transit, and our aim is to increase this amount. Reaching this goal is facilitated by the NYC zoning strategy, which up-zones areas close to transit to allow additional density. Meanwhile, areas far from transit are down-zoned, which has the simultaneous impact of preserving the character of those neighborhoods. The number of permits issued should not, however, be equated with housing completion data.<br /><br /> We measure the energy used per capita by NYC residential buildings to track the energy intensity of our housing stock from year to year. We expect residential energy usage, and per capita GHG emissions, to fall as the effects of the Greener Greater Buildings Bill (passed December 2009) and other actions take effect.<\/p>","<h3>Waterways<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/html/onenyc/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">OneNYC<\/a> is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York City's future.<\/p>\n<p>Goal: Improve the quality of our waterways to increase opportunities for recreation and to restore coastal ecosystems.<\/p>\n<p>New York State sets water quality standards, and NYC monitors New York Harbor water quality on an annual basis through the Harbor Survey. The survey uses 36 stations located throughout the open waters of the harbor and 19 stations located in smaller tributaries within the city. These stations take water samples every month and test for a number of contaminants. Average dissolved oxygen concentration and fecal coliform levels are two of the most commonly-accepted indicators of harbor health.<\/p>\n<h3>Dissolved Oxygen<\/h3>\n<p>Sufficient concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the water column are critical for the respiration of most aquatic life forms, including fish and invertebrates such as crabs, clams, and zooplankton. Dissolved oxygen concentration is, therefore, one of the most universal indicators of overall water quality and the condition of habitats and ecosystems. <br /><br />We report the average levels of dissolved oxygen harbor-wide, from surface and bottom water, on an annual basis. Rising dissolved oxygen levels, and levels above the state standard (5.0 mg/L) indicate a harbor suitable to most aquatic life forms. Since the 1990s, surface and bottom water dissolved oxygen levels have been above New York State standards for fishing and boating (4.0 mg/L) as well as for bathing and other recreational use (5.0 mg/L), and are continuing to improve.<\/p>\n<h3>Fecal Coliforms<\/h3>\n<p>Fecal coliforms are a group of bacteria primarily found in human and animal intestines, and their concentration in water is considered an accurate indication of sewage-related pollution. Though most fecal coliform bacteria do not cause disease, their concentrations are a good indicator of the presence of pathogenic (disease-producing) bacteria.<br /><br />Since the 1990s, harbor-wide surface water fecal coliform levels have been below the state standard for fishing and boating (monthly geometric mean less than or equal to 2,000 cells/100mL from 5 or more samples), as well as the state standard for bathing and other recreational use (monthly geometric mean less than or equal to 200 cells/100mL from 5 or more samples). However, short-term spikes may occur after heavy rain. The city is committed to addressing these spikes to increase opportunities for recreation.<\/p>","<h3>About Carbon Monoxide<\/h3>\n<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a poisonous gas that forms when fuel or other materials are burned.&nbsp; It is invisible and has no odor.&nbsp; Even short-term exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide can be fatal.<\/p>\n<p>This site contains data on unintentional carbon monoxide incidents and emergency responses by the <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/html/home2.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">New York City Fire Department (FDNY)<\/a>, reports to the <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/poison-control.page\" target=\"_blank\">NYC Poison Control Center (PCC)<\/a> of actual or potential carbon monoxide exposure and hospitalizations of NYC residents who have been poisoned by carbon monoxide.<\/p>\n<h3>Carbon Monoxide and Health<\/h3>\n<p>Carbon monoxide exerts its toxic effects by blocking oxygen transport in the body.&nbsp; Breathing in high concentrations of carbon monoxide can cause loss of consciousness, death or permanent neurological injury. <br />&nbsp;<br />Symptoms of mild carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness and disorientation.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>The frequency of carbon monoxide poisonings that occur in NYC may be underestimated in these data for several reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Symptoms of mild to moderate carbon monoxide poisoning are non-specific, and may be confused with flu-like illness.<\/li>\n<li>Persons experiencing symptoms may not seek medical treatment or call the Poison Control Center.<\/li>\n<li>Though all poisonings are reportable to the Department of Health, many health care providers may not report them.<\/li>\n<li>Deaths are relatively rare and therefore reported as citywide totals only, which cannot be mapped.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>To help prevent carbon monoxide poisoning:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Residential property owners are required by NYC law to install and maintain smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Make sure your home has working detectors that can be heard from any bedroom. Test your detectors and replace their batteries at least twice a year. Never remove the batteries to use in another device, even for a short time.<\/li>\n<li>Never use a gas stove, oven or other cooking appliance to heat your home.&nbsp; And never use unvented gas space heaters - they're illegal.&nbsp; Tenants should call 311 to report heating problems that landlords fail to repair. Home owners should have heating systems inspected before each winter season.<\/li>\n<li>If using an emergency generator when the power goes out, never run it indoors or near any enclosed space. Keep it outside, far away from any doors or windows.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid carbon monoxide hazards around motor vehicles. On cold days, check to make sure the tail pipe under the vehicle is clear of snow before starting the engine, and never warm up a car inside a garage.&nbsp; Never swim or do any water sports close to the exhaust outlet on a boat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>Nationally and locally, the rates of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning have slowly declined over the past three decades.&nbsp; However, carbon monoxide remains a common cause of life-threatening and fatal poisonings. From 2000 to 2005, more than 400 NYC residents were hospitalized and 30 died as a result of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning.<br /><br />In 2004, NYC became one of the first major cities to require carbon monoxide detectors in residential buildings.<\/p>","<h3 id=\"descriptiontitle\">About Mice and Rats<\/h3>\n<p>Rats and mice are common, but preventable. In NYC, rats tend to be seen on streets and sidewalks, and in backyards and basements, while mice are almost always found inside homes.<\/p>\n<p>Rats and mice thrive where there are sources of food and shelter and where property owners fail to prevent and adequately respond to their presence.<\/p>\n<p>This site provides survey data on the prevalence of mice or rats inside and outside of buildings. This information is collected by the US Census Bureau through the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/housing/nychvs/\" target=\"_blank\">NYC Housing and Vacancy Survey<\/a>, and by the <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/community-health-survey.page\" target=\"_blank\">NYC Health Department through Community Health Surveys<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Mice, Rats and Health<\/h3>\n<p>The presence of rats in communities has been historically associated with a variety of infectious diseases. Today, rats are principally recognized for their contribution to neighborhood stress, poor quality of life, contamination of food, and for their contribution to the destruction of infrastructure. Mice can contaminate food, and their urine and dander are potent allergens, which can exacerbate the symptoms of asthma in sensitive people.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p>Data on mice and rats come from the Housing and Vacancy Survey (HVS), and the Community Health Survey (CHS). Because these are sample surveys, all data derived from them are estimates, not exact counts. <br /><br />The accuracy of survey data depends on the participants' ability to recall and correctly report mice or rat sightings. <br /><br />More extensive data are available on the Rat Information Portal.

When owners fail to address these conditions, NYC residents can call 311 to report the problem.<\/li>\n<li>Use caulk and plaster to seal holes and cracks in walls, floors and ceilings.<\/li>\n<li>Store food in sealed containers, and do not put out food for stray cats, pigeons or squirrels.<\/li>\n<li>Remove garbage daily from apartments, and put garbage on the curb as close to pickup time as possible. Use hard plastic or metal cans with tight fitting lids.<\/li>\n<li>Reduce clutter and piling of newspapers and cardboard.<\/li>\n<li>Keep landscaped areas around properties free of tall weeds and trim shrubs that are close to the ground.<\/li>\n<li>Control pests safely and effectively. Commercial and multi-unit property owners must hire a pest control company to place rodent baits. Employ pest control services that use preventive measures - not just pesticides. Rodent bait should only be used in enclosed tamper-proof containers. &nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Get together with your neighbors to address mice and rat problems on your block or neighborhood. Clean up several yards in the same area, and encourage buildings near you to work with you to reduce garbage problems, weeds, or clutter that attract rodents. This way, re-infestation from nearby rodents is less likely.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>Beginning in 2008, the Department of Health began to systematically and pro-actively evaluate the presence of rats in Bronx neighborhoods in a program referred to as \"rat indexing.\" By rapidly notifying property owners, providing detailed advice on how to improve conditions, and by engaging the public, the Department now encourages whole blocks and neighborhoods to simultaneously concentrate their resources to maximize the effect of extermination and cleanup efforts. <br /><br />The Department of Health offers training and information on safe and effective pest control to communities, pest management professionals, restaurant operators and building superintendents.

Since 1999, the Croton system has served as a supplemental water system, and the Catskill/Delaware reservoir system has supplied almost all NYC drinking water.<\/p>\n<p>We display data on disinfection by-products, nitrates, and arsenic in NYC drinking water because these contaminants occur most frequently at levels that may be of public health significance in drinking water nationwide. Additional contaminants of emerging concern nationwide have either not been detected or detected at very low levels in the NYC drinking water system. These include atrazine, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), radium, and uranium.<\/p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/drinking_water/lead_index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">NYC DEP<\/a> drinking water enters the NYC water system &ldquo;virtually lead-free&rdquo;.The DEP then uses anti-corrosion methods to reduce the leaching of any lead that may be present in plumbing fixtures, solder, or pipes that connect the water system to the thousands of buildings in NYC. Federal regulations require that lead testing of water is done at the tap of a sample NYC buildings each year.&nbsp; In 2015, 90% of those samples tested below the action level of 15 &mu;g/L. More detailed data on NYC drinking water quality and lead testing procedures and results can be found <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/drinking_water/wsstate.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Drinking Water Quality and Health<\/h3>\n<p>Drinking water in NYC is monitored regularly for biological and chemical contaminants, for the purpose of protecting public health and checking compliance with state and federal rules. Monitoring drinking water is important because contamination in a single system could expose many people at once. People can be exposed to contaminants in drinking water not only by drinking the water, but also by eating foods prepared with the water, breathing water droplets or chemicals released from the water while showering, or by absorbing chemicals through their skin while bathing.<br /><br />Drinking water is disinfected to reduce the possibility of illness from microorganisms. Disinfection by-products (DBPs) are chemicals that can form when a disinfectant such as chlorine reacts with naturally occurring organic matter and other substances in the source water. Current research is investigating whether there are health effects from chronic exposure to the by-products of water disinfection.<br /><br />Nitrates are nitrogen-oxygen molecules commonly found in water where nitrogen-based fertilizers are used nearby.&nbsp; Decades ago, it was discovered that infants who were fed formula made with water containing nitrates over 10 mg/L sometimes became seriously ill, due to the interference of nitrate with the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.<br /><br />Arsenic is naturally-occurring in groundwater systems in some parts of the US. It may also enter drinking water systems as a result of past use of arsenic-containing pesticides and wood preservatives. Chronic exposure may increase risk of certain cancers. <br /><br /><\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/home/home.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)<\/a> regularly samples, analyzes and reports contaminant levels at the source, and in the drinking water distribution system. The data presented here provide summary measures of contaminants in drinking water sampled at many points in the distribution system. <br /><br />DBPs are divided into two families: total trihalomethanes (chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) and five haloacetic acids (trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, monochloroacetic acid, dibromoacetic acid, and monobromoacetic acid).&nbsp; <br /><br /><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>The <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#MCL\" target=\"_blank\">maximum contaminant levels (MCLs)<\/a> set by EPA are:<\/td>\n<td>&nbsp;<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>o Arsenic<\/td>\n<td>10 &micro;g/L<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>o Nitrate<\/td>\n<td>10 mg/L<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>o DBP: Total Trihalomethanes (TTHM)<\/td>\n<td>80 &micro;g/L<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>o DBP: Haloacetic Acids (HAA5)<\/td>\n<td>60 &micro;g/L<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.17em;\">Prevention<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Most people do not need to take any actions to prevent water-related illnesses or health effects from drinking NYC water.<\/li>\n<li>Though levels of contaminants are consistently very low in water that arrives to a building, lead or lead-soldered plumbing in some older buildings may raise lead levels in water at the tap. Reducing the possibility of exposure to lead in drinking water is simple and inexpensive: Run your tap for at least 30 seconds, until the water is noticeably colder, before drinking, cooking or making baby formula. Free tap water quality tests are available by calling 311.<\/li>\n<li>Ultimately, maintaining the highest quality drinking water depends on protecting our lakes, rivers and aquifers from contamination.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>The quality of the drinking water in the NYC system is excellent. The water systems serving NYC are consistently in compliance with EPA guidelines. <br /><br />DBP concentrations show a seasonal effect with higher concentrations during the warm and rainy months when more organic material is in the water systems. Arsenic levels are consistently very low in NYC.&nbsp; Nitrate levels are also consistently low, owing to the protection of upstate watersheds from farm runoff.&nbsp; <br /><br />NYC drinking water has many advantages over bottled water or processed beverages: its sources are known, its purity is checked, it is not stored in plastics, it does not get shipped into the City using trucks that pollute our air, it costs little or nothing, and it is calorie-free.<\/p>","<p>More information coming soon.&nbsp;<\/p>","<p>More information coming soon.<\/p>","<p><h3  id=\"descriptiontitle\">About Birth Defects<\/h3 ><\/p>\n<p>Birth defects (also called congenital malformations) are conditions that happen when a baby does not develop normally during pregnancy. Structural defects may include missing limbs, malformed hearts, <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Spina_Bifida\" target=\"_blank\">spina bifida<\/a>&nbsp;and genetic conditions like <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Down_Syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Down syndrome<\/a>. Most birth defects happen during the first three months of pregnancy and are detected within the first year of life. Some birth defects (such as <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Cleft_Lip\" target=\"_blank\">cleft lip<\/a> or clubfoot) are easy to see, but others (such as heart defects or hearing loss) are found using special tests (such as x-rays, CT scans, or hearing tests). Birth defects can vary from mild to severe.<\/p>\n<p>This site provides data on NYC children born with one or more of 12 major birth defects. Each of the 12 birth defects is defined in the glossary on this site. The data comes from the <a href=\"http://www.health.state.ny.us/diseases/congenital_malformations/cmrhome.htm\" target=\"_blank\">NYS Department of Health Congenital Malformations Registry<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><h3 >Birth Defects and the Environment<\/h3 ><br />Scientists believe most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors including our genes, behaviors and environment. However, the causes of most birth defects are unknown. The fetus is more sensitive to exposures than an adult and if exposures happen during important periods of development, birth defects may result. Although there has been some research into how environmental exposures might cause birth defects, there is still much more work that needs to be done to understand the relationship of these exposures to birth defects.<br /><br />Known and probable risk factors for birth defects include the following: smoking, use of alcohol and other drugs, poor nutrition and/or health (such as low levels of folic acid, obesity and poorly controlled diabetes), some medicines (prescription &amp; over-the-counter), toxic chemicals (such as lead, paint and paint thinner, gasoline, pesticides, and secondhand smoke), infectious agents (such as rubella and toxoplasmosis) and ionizing radiation (x-rays). <br /><br /><\/p><p><h3 >About the Data and Indicators<\/h3 ><br />Collecting and sharing good data about the occurrence of birth defects is a first step in understanding how they might be related to the environment. Looking at patterns of birth defect rates can help health officials plan services and create ideas for research into environmental causes of birth defects.<br /><br />All birth defects in any child less than two years old are reportable under New York State law to the State Congenital Malformations Registry. <br /><br />Most birth defect reports are abstracted from inpatient hospital records, since birth defects diagnosed on an outpatient basis are not well reported. <br /><br />Accurate hospital clinical recognition of birth defects depends on clinical expertise and interest. This is particularly true of conditions more difficult to diagnose. As a result, identification of birth defects may vary by area and by time. Areas with hospitals that provide higher levels of care may have more thorough diagnoses and, thus, apparently higher rates. Similarly, areas with hospitals that report cases more completely will also appear to have higher rates.<br /><br /><\/p><p><h3  id=\"descriptiontitle\">Prevention<\/h3 ><\/p>\n<p>Not all birth defects can be prevented, but actions that increase the chance of having a healthy baby include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have regular medical checkups and check with a provider before taking any medications.<\/li>\n<li>Eat healthy foods and maintain a healthy weight; avoid alcohol and don't use street drugs.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure that medical conditions like diabetes are under control.<\/li>\n<li>Take a vitamin with folic acid before and during pregnancy.<\/li>\n<li>Quit smoking and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.<\/li>\n<li>Damaged lead-containing paint in homes should be safely addressed by properly trained workers, ideally prior to pregnancy.&nbsp; Pregnant women and small children should stay out of the home until lead paint projects are completed.<\/li>\n<li>Employers should provide workplaces free from unsafe chemical exposures and provide protective gear to workers when necessary. To learn more about the chemicals at work, employees can ask their employer for the <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Material_Safety_Data_Sheets\" target=\"_blank\">Material Safety Data Sheets<\/a> for the products used.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p><h3 >Key Messages<\/h3 ><br />About one out of every 33 babies is born with a birth defect. A birth defect can affect almost any part of the body. The well being of the child who is born with a birth defect depends mostly on which organ or body part is involved, how much it is affected and the quality of rehabilitative support received in early childhood. <br /><br />Heart defects make up about one-third to one-fourth of all birth defects, affecting about one in every 100 to 200 births. Some of these heart defects can be serious, and a few are very severe. <br /><br />Other common birth defects are \"neural tube defects,\" which are defects of the spine (<a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Spina_Bifida\" target=\"_blank\">spina bifida<\/a>) and brain (<a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Anencephaly\" target=\"_blank\">anencephaly<\/a>). They affect about one of every 1,000 pregnancies. These defects can be serious and are often life threatening. <br /><br />Birth defects of the lip and roof of the mouth, known as \"<a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Orofacial_clefts\" target=\"_blank\">orofacial clefts<\/a>,\" include <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Cleft_Lip\" target=\"_blank\">cleft lip<\/a>, <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Cleft_Palate\" target=\"_blank\">cleft palate<\/a>, and combined cleft lip and cleft palate. These defects are also common and occur in about one in 700 to 1,000 babies. <br /><br /><\/p>","<h3>About Childhood Cancers<\/h3>\n<p>Cancer begins when cells in a part of the body start to grow out of control. There are many kinds of cancer, but they all start because of out-of-control growth of abnormal cells. Leukemia (cancer of the blood-forming cells) is the most common form of childhood cancer. There are different kinds of childhood leukemia. The most common kinds are <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Leukemia\" target=\"_blank\">acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)<\/a> and <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Leukemia\" target=\"_blank\">acute myeloid leukemia (AML)<\/a>. Brain and other nervous system cancers are the second most common types of childhood cancers. Of all childhood cancer, leukemias and brain and other nervous system cancers account for about 50% of cases among children less than 15 years old.<\/p>\n<p>This site contains data on total cancers, total leukemias, ALL and AML separately, and brain and other nervous system cancers in children. The data comes from the <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#NYS_Cancer_Registry\" target=\"_blank\">NYS Cancer Registry<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Childhood Cancer and the Environment<\/h3>\n<p>The causes of most childhood cancer are unknown. It is especially difficult to identify environmental factors related to childhood cancers because - like adult cancer - they are likely to be the result of a mix of genetic, environmental, and behavioral causes, and not just one factor by itself. Exposures to the parent, the fetus in the womb, or the child after birth may all play a role. Some risk factors that explain a small percentage of cases include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation<\/li>\n<li>Genetic abnormalities and conditions, including Down Syndrome<\/li>\n<li>Exposure to chemotherapy drugs known as alkylating agents<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>Data are reported over five-year periods because the number of cases and rates for single years can vary considerably, particularly for less common types of cancer.<br /><br />Counts and rates are calculated based upon residential address at time of diagnosis. Because cancer latencies can be long, the neighborhood of residence at the time of diagnosis may not be the same as the residence at the time an earlier exposure may have occurred.<br /><br />All cancers diagnosed among NYS residents are required by law to be reported to the NYS Cancer Registry. The registry is considered to have 95% or higher case ascertainment.<br /><br />The cancer indicators included in this portal were chosen by a National workgroup of the Tracking Network because they are potentially related to environmental exposures, or there is public concern that they may be related.<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>The risk of many adult cancers can be reduced by certain lifestyle changes (such as maintaining a healthy weight or quitting smoking). Less is known about ways to prevent cancer in children. The good news is that there are effective treatments for many childhood cancers. Since the 1970's, death rates have declined dramatically and survival rates have increased for most childhood cancers.<\/p>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>In NYC, about 18 children out of 100,000 under the age of 20 are likely to develop cancer. Most are leukemias. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) accounts for about 3 out of 4 leukemia cases. Most of the remaining cases are acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Chronic leukemias are rare in children. &nbsp;<br /><br /> ALL is most common in early childhood, peaking between 2 and 4 years of age. Cases of AML are more spread out across the childhood years, although they occur more commonly during the first 2 years of life and during the teenage years.<br /><br /> Despite its rarity and the major advances in treatment and supportive care, cancer is still the leading cause of death from disease in children younger than 15 years old.<\/p>","<h3>Solid Waste<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"PlaNYC Home Page\" href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/home/home.shtml\">PlaNYC<\/a> is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York City's future.<\/p>\n<p>Goal: Divert 75% of solid waste from landfills.<\/p>\n<h3>Divert Solid Waste<\/h3>\n<p>Of the city's 13.6 million tons of waste per year, we currently recycle 51% of solid waste (including fill) and send 43% to landfills. The remainder is composted or converted to energy. <br /><br /> We are working to increase the amount diverted to recycling, composting, and conversion to 75%. Diverting solid waste from landfills to recycling and conversion facilities make use of our waste, creating new materials, nutrient sources, and energy out of our waste products. And while we no longer operate landfills in New York City, the waste we send to distant landfills contributes to environmental problems such as greenhouse gas emissions and potential water contamination. Closer to home, reduced truck trips bound for landfills will improve air quality.<br /><br /> We have characterized the types of solid waste generated from residential sources, which account for 29% of the waste stream, and determined that 35% of that waste is recyclable while 40% of it is compostable. However of the materials that can be recycled, New Yorkers are only recycling 47% of metal, plastic, and glass and 38% of paper, and less than 1% is composted. We are working to characterize the types of solid waste generated from commercial sources, which account for 24% of the waste stream, less easily quantified because it is handled by private waste haulers. Overall, efforts to recycle paper, cardboard, metal, glass, plastic, tires and asphalt millings, and derelict vehicles; and to dispose of or reuse fill or dirt from excavation sites, construction and demolition materials, household hazardous waste, and textiles and furniture should enable us to reach our target of diverting 75% of solid waste from landfills by 2030.<\/p>","<h3>About Pesticides<\/h3>\n<p>Pesticides are chemicals applied to kill or control insects, rats and mice, undesirable plants and weeds, or fungi (e.g., mold). Pesticides are often categorized by type of use (e.g., rodenticide, insecticide) or chemical class (e.g., <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Organophosphate\" target=\"_blank\">organophosphate<\/a>, <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Pyrethroids\" target=\"_blank\">pyrethroid<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Modern pesticides have been developed to have less persistence in the environment than earlier chlorine-based chemicals such as DDT. Pesticides may be applied by a commercial applicator or a non-professional who has purchased a product from a store.<\/p>\n<p>This portal summarizes data about the quantity, types and locations of pesticides that are applied by state-certified pesticide applicators. Using survey data, the portal also reports data on peoples' personal use of pesticides, and the frequency with which a pest control professional visits homes.<\/p>\n<h3>Pesticides and Health<\/h3>\n<p>Exposure to pesticides can occur from consuming foods or beverages that contain pesticide residues, from direct contact with the skin or eyes, or from breathing air in areas where pesticides are applied. Health effects from exposure to pesticides vary by chemical class. In general, short-term effects on humans from high levels of exposure include damage to the skin and eyes, difficulty breathing, neurological tremors or seizure and, in extreme cases, loss of consciousness and death. Current research is investigating whether chronic exposure to certain pesticides increases risk of some cancers, reproductive and developmental problems and neurodegenerative diseases such as <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Parkinsons_disease\" target=\"_blank\">Parkinson's disease<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p>Earlier years (1999-2002) of commercial pesticide reporting are more likely to contain inconsistencies based on differences in reporting quantities before or after dilution.<br /><br /> Under-reporting of commercial application probably occurs despite the legal reporting requirements.<br /><br />Liquid and solid forms of the same chemicals are not combined, which prevents presentation of total pesticide applications in some cases.<br /><br />Data on personal pesticide use and exterminator visits are measured using surveys that depend on the study participants' accurate recollections and reporting.<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>To reduce exposure to pesticides, NYC promotes the practice of <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Integrated_Pest_Management\" target=\"_blank\">integrated pest management<\/a>.

They are often confused with other insects, and many people are not even aware of their presence until they have been bitten. However, not everyone has a reaction to bed bug bites. You may not discover that you have bed bugs until you see other signs of the pests such as, bed bugs themselves, their eggs or droppings, or the blood stains they leave behind in mattresses, box springs, chairs or other materials.<\/p>\n<p>Bed bugs spread mainly by hitchhiking onto furniture, luggage and clothing, and by travelling along spaces that connect apartments, and rooms in commercial and institutional settings. Effective control requires cooperation with your neighbors, landlord and pest management provider. It is hard but not impossible to get rid of bed bugs. Do not try to get rid of them on your own. Get help from a well-trained and licensed pest management professional. Anyone can get bed bugs. Seek help immediately if you find them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Bed Bugs and Health<\/h3>\n<p><br /> Although bed bugs and their bites are a nuisance, they are not known to spread disease. Other health-related consequences have been noted:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bed bug bites can be very itchy and irritating. Most welts heal in a few days but in unusual cases, the welt may persist for several weeks. An anti-itching ointment can help, but if bites become infected, people should see their doctor.<\/li>\n<li>The anxiety about being bitten can lead to sleeplessness, which can affect well-being. Properly and effectively responding to bed bugs helps to keep anxiety in check.<\/li>\n<li>Some people become so desperate that they use illegal or excessive amounts of pesticides which can lead to poisonings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p><br />Estimates of numbers and percentages of adults reporting bed bugs in their homes are measured using survey data. The accuracy of the survey data depends on the participants&rsquo; ability to recall and correctly report the presence of bed bugs. <br /><br /><\/p>\n<h3>Prevention and Control<\/h3>\n<p><br />In New York City, building owners are required by law to provide apartments free of pests, but residents can also take steps to prevent the spread of bed bugs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never bring bed frames, mattresses, box springs or upholstered furniture found on the street into your home, and check all used or rented furniture for bed bugs.<\/li>\n<li>When traveling, inspect the bed and furniture. Keep suitcases off the floor and bed, and inspect them before you leave.<\/li>\n<li>If you suspect you have been around bed bugs, immediately wash and dry your clothing on hot settings, or store items in a sealed plastic bag until you can.<\/li>\n<li>Seal cracks and crevices with caulk, even if you don't have bed bugs. This will help prevent pests from coming in and spreading to other locations. &nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Do not use pesticide bombs or foggers to control pests, because they can make conditions worse. Get professional help to control bed bugs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","<p>Coming soon!<\/p>\n<p>limit<\/p>","Neighborhood Poverty    ","<h3 id=\"descriptiontitle\">About Cigarette Smoke<\/h3>\n<p>Cigarette smoke contains over 250 toxic chemicals, more than 50 of which cause cancer. Secondhand smoke is a dangerous combination of the smoke from the burning of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar, and the smoke exhaled by a smoker. There is no safe level of secondhand smoke exposure. Even brief exposure can be harmful.<\/p>\n<p>This site provides data on: teen and adult smoking, adults' exposure to cigarette smoke at home or at work and adults with a policy banning smoking in their home. The data are from NYC Health Department's<a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/community-health-survey.page\" target=\"_blank\"> Community Health Surveys<\/a>, and Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Surveys.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Cigarette Smoke and Health<\/h3>\n<p>Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disease, and causes illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung disease, and problems during and after pregnancy. In fact, smoking cigarettes kills more New Yorkers each year than AIDS, drugs, homicide, and suicide combined.<br /><br />Non-smokers exposed to cigarette smoke at home or work increase their risk of heart disease by 25-30% and their risk of lung cancer by 20-30%. Infants and young children are especially prone to health problems caused by secondhand smoke (e.g., pneumonia and bronchitis, ear infections, asthma, and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat). Babies exposed to cigarette smoke or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy are at an increased risk for <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Sudden_Infant_Death_Syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)<\/a>.<br /><br />In 2002, NYC enacted its Smoke Free Air Act, which prohibits smoking in all workplaces, including restaurants and bars. The primary intent of this law is to protect workers from exposure to secondhand smoke. In that same year, the Health Department estimated that more people (about 1,000 every year) are killed by secondhand smoke than by homicide. In addition, secondhand smoke causes illness (e.g., ear infections, asthma, and respiratory infections) in more than 40,000 NYC adults and children every year.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>Cigarette smoke exposure is measured using surveys that depend on the study participants' accurate recollections and reporting.<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pregnant women, infants, young children, and people with breathing problems are especially vulnerable to the poisons in secondhand smoke. The only way to fully protect others from secondhand smoke is to quit smoking and have a 100% smoke-free environment.<\/li>\n<li>Remember, it is never too late to stop smoking. Quitting smoking is the single most important thing you can do for your health. If you want help quitting, call 311.<\/li>\n<li>Don't allow smoking in your home or car. Go outside to smoke, and smoke away from people. Ask those who visit your home or ride in your car not to smoke.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure that children learn and play in smoke-free environments. In NY, all tobacco products are banned on public and private school grounds during school hours and school activities. Work with parent/teacher associations, school boards, and administrators to support this law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>About 950,000 adult New Yorkers are still smoking. If you are a smoker, quitting smoking is the single most important thing you can do for your health.<br /><br />Over 300,000 adult New Yorkers were exposed to cigarette smoke in their homes in 2008. Of these, almost half were non-smokers. In fact, over 1.5 million New Yorkers do not have a policy against smoking in their home.<br /><br />There is no safe level of exposure to cigarette smoke. Even brief exposure can be harmful to your health.<\/p>","<h3>About Childhood Lead Exposure<\/h3>\n<p>Childhood lead poisoning is a serious but preventable public health problem. Lead is a toxic metal that can cause learning and behavior problems, and delay physical growth and mental development. Testing for lead poisoning is a key component of childhood lead poisoning prevention, since most children with elevated blood lead levels exhibit no symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>This site provides data on blood lead testing and on elevated blood lead levels among NYC children. The data are collected by the NYC Health Department's <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/lead-poisoning-prevention.page\" target=\"_blank\">Healthy Homes Program<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Childhood Lead Exposure and Health<\/h3>\n<p>Lead is found naturally in the environment but is also found in manufactured products. In the past, it was used in products such as gasoline and paint, ceramic products, caulking and pipes and solder, but its use in these products has been dramatically reduced. In 1960, NYC banned the use of lead-based paint in homes. A national ban came into effect in 1978.&nbsp;Leaded gasoline was phased out beginning in the 1970's. However, lead can still be found in some products and in our environment. People may be exposed to lead by absorbing, breathing or swallowing lead or lead dust. Once it enters the body, lead can become a health hazard. Children are more vulnerable to lead poisoning in the first six years of life, particularly the first three, when the brain grows the fastest, and when critical connections in the brain and nervous system that control thought, learning, hearing, movement, behavior and emotions are formed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Lead paint is the primary cause of childhood lead poisoning in NYC.&nbsp; Other sources include imported foods, spices, toys and cosmetics; water in buildings with older pipes; uncovered soil in play areas; travel to countries where environmental lead is poorly controlled.&nbsp; <a title=\"Open the Childhood Lead Poisoning page in a new tab\" href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/health-tools/childhood-lead-poisoning.page\" target=\"_blank\">HHP educates families<\/a> about things they can do to reduce these exposures and prevent childhood lead poisoning.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>This section of the portal provides indicators and measures on children tested for lead poisoning before the age of three and on children with blood lead levels of 5 mcg/dL or greater. In 2012, CDC established that a blood lead level of 5 mcg/dL is the reference level for exposure to lead in children. This level is used to identify children who have blood lead levels higher than most children's levels. The reference level is determined by measuring the NHANES blood lead distribution in US children ages 1 to 5 years, and is reviewed every 4 years.<\/p>\n<p>Data on lead paint hazards, the most common source of lead exposure for children, can be found under the topic &ldquo;Built Environment&rdquo; on this portal.&nbsp;Additional lead data are available through <a title=\"Open the Lead health publications page in a new tab\" href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/lead-pubs.page\" target=\"_blank\">publications and annual reports to City Council<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>To prevent exposure to lead hazards you can do the following:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Call 311 if your landlord does not fix peeling paint, or if you think repair work is being done unsafely.<\/li>\n<li>Call 311 if you live in a one- or two-family house with peeling paint and have a child under six years old. Ask for the Health Department's Healthy Homes Program (HHP).<\/li>\n<li>Wash floors, window sills, hands, toys and pacifiers often.<\/li>\n<li>Do not use imported foods, spices, clay pots and dishes,medicines, toys and cosmetics that have been found to contain lead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All children should be tested for lead poisoning at ages one and two. Health care providers should also test other children found to be at risk and annually assess children from six months to six years of age for lead exposure risk.<\/p>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>Childhood lead poisoning in NYC has declined dramatically over the last decade.<br /><br />The main source of childhood lead poisoning in the United States is lead-based paint in older, deteriorated housing. Chipping, flaking and peeling paint and paint disturbed during home remodeling contributes to lead dust and contaminates bare soil around a home. Children can be exposed by eating lead-based paint chips, chewing on objects painted with lead-based paint or swallowing house dust or soil that contains lead.<br /><br />Information on other sources of lead poisoning can be found <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/lead-poisoning-prevention.page\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<br /><br /><\/p>","<h3>About Alcohol<\/h3>\n<p>Heavy regular drinking and binge drinking contribute to a wide range of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, cirrhosis, depression and dementia. Alcohol use is also associated with suicide, homicide, domestic violence, sexually transmitted diseases and injuries. It is one of the leading behavior-related causes of death in New York City (NYC).<\/p>\n<p>This site provides data on heavy alcohol consumption and alcohol outlets in NYC.<\/p>\n<h3>Alcohol and the Environment<\/h3>\n<p>Greater alcohol outlet density has been associated with a variety of health and social consequences, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alcohol-related hospitalizations<\/li>\n<li>Violent crime, assault and homicide<\/li>\n<li>Child abuse and intimate partner violence<\/li>\n<li>Liver cirrhosis mortality<\/li>\n<li>Motor vehicle injuries<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Alcohol advertising &ndash; at point-of-sale and other locations &ndash; permeates the NYC environment. Research suggests that exposing youth to alcohol advertising is associated with increased interest in drinking alcohol.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>Alcohol drinking is measured in the NYC Health Department&rsquo;s Community Health Surveys. We define heavy drinking as an average of more than two drinks per day for men or more than one drink per day for women. We define binge drinking as five or more drinks on one occasion, and as of 2011, four or more drinks for women. The accuracy of estimates derived from surveys depends in part on participants&rsquo; ability to recall and honestly report their behavior.<br /><br />Alcohol outlets data are provided by the New York State Liquor Authority, which licenses establishment to sell alcoholic beverages. Establishments are categorized as service or retail. Service outlets are defined as locations where the patron purchases and consumes the alcohol in the same place (on-premise), such as a bar or restaurant. Retail outlets are defined as locations where the patron purchases the alcohol on-site such as at a grocery or liquor store but must consume the alcohol elsewhere (off-premise).<\/p>\n<h3>Preventing Harmful Drinking<\/h3>\n<p>Effective policies and practices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enforce laws prohibiting sale of alcohol to youth and to those already intoxicated.<\/li>\n<li>Limit the density of alcohol outlets.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Industry controls:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limit the use of drink specials or promotions.<\/li>\n<li>Use standard measures for drinks.<\/li>\n<li>Maintain a limit on the number or drinks a person can consume.<\/li>\n<li>Provide training and education to employees to encourage responsible alcohol sales and consumption.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Health care providers should incorporate universal screening for alcohol problems into medical care settings.<\/p>","<h3 id=\"descriptiontitle\">About Physical Activity<\/h3>\n<p>Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Regular physical activity is associated with many health benefits, including improved fitness, prevention of weight gain, and lower risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes and some cancers. In addition, regular physical activity and healthy eating can promote well-being and relieve stress. For children, regular physical activity is also associated with improved academic performance.<\/p>\n<h3>Physical Activity and the Environment<\/h3>\n<p>Neighborhood conditions and resources can encourage or discourage healthy behaviors. Aspects of the physical environment - such as the presence of well-maintained green spaces, bicycle paths, walking paths, stairs, exercise facilities and perceived safety - encourage physical activity. Healthy food choices combined with physically active lifestyle support maintenance of an optimal bodyweight and overall good health.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>Physical activity indicators presented on this site are derived from the biennial NYC Youth Risk Behavior Survey and the annual Community Health Survey. They are estimates that depend on study participants' accurate recollections and reporting.<\/p>\n<h3>Health Promotion Strategies<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Walk or bike to work and to run errands.<\/li>\n<li>Get off the subway a stop or two early and walk the rest of the way.<\/li>\n<li>Take the stairs instead of the elevator.<\/li>\n<li>Maintain good nutrition habits to support an active lifestyle, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Drink very low calorie beverages, like water and unsweetened tea. Avoid sugary drinks.<\/li>\n<li>Eat smaller portions that include more fruits and vegetables.<\/li>\n<li>Use healthy fats, such as canola and olive oils. Avoid unhealthy fats, such as lard, butter and trans fat-containing foods.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>In spite of the potential benefits, many New Yorkers do not get the recommended 30 or more minutes of physical activity on five or more days of the week.<\/p>","NA","<h3>About traffic injuries in New York City<\/h3>\n<p><span class=\"TextRun  BCX0 SCXW44719960\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun  BCX0 SCXW44719960\">Traffic<\/span><\/span><span class=\"TextRun  BCX0 SCXW44719960\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun  BCX0 SCXW44719960\">&nbsp;injuries are no accident<\/span><\/span><span class=\"TextRun  BCX0 SCXW44719960\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun  BCX0 SCXW44719960\">.

Exposures to two common air pollutants, <a href=\"Glossary.aspx#Fine_particulate_matter\" target=\"_blank\">fine particulate matter (PM2.5)<\/a> and <a href=\"Glossary.aspx#Ground_level_ozone\" target=\"_blank\">ozone (O3)<\/a>, can worsen respiratory illness and heart conditions and contribute to premature deaths. Older adults, children and people with existing heart and lung disease are especially affected. This site provides estimates of the impact of air pollution on the health of NYC residents as measured by the numbers of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths attributable to PM2.5 and ozone.<\/p>\n<h3>About PM2.5, Ozone and Health<\/h3>\n<p>Fine particulate matter, also known as (PM2.5), are small airborne particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs. Major sources of PM2.5 include trucks, buses and cars, and the burning of fossil fuel to generate electric power and heat buildings. Exposure to particulate matter has been linked to breathing problems, reduced lung function, heart disease and premature death. Ozone, also called smog, causes irritation and inflammation of the lungs and worsening of asthma. <br /><br /><\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>PM2.5 and ozone attributable health events are estimated using well established health impact methods often used to estimate the changes in the number of illnesses and deaths that could occur in a population if air pollution concentrations were reduced by a specified amount. This method:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uses air quality monitoring data from EPA&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/aqs\" target=\"_blank\">Air Quality System<\/a> to characterize current or baseline air pollution levels<\/li>\n<li>Specifies comparison of air quality conditions, such as background levels of air pollution without any man-made emissions, also called modeled natural background level<\/li>\n<li>Computes change in air pollution levels as the difference between the current level and the comparison level for each neighborhood<\/li>\n<li>Uses the change in air pollution levels, concentration-response functions from epidemiological studies, and information about the local population and baseline emergency room visits, hospitalization and death rates to calculate the health impact associated with the change in air quality in each neighborhood.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/eode/eode-air-quality-impact.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report<\/a> for detailed descriptions of health impact methodologies.<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>To help improve air quality and reduce the risk of health effects from air pollution:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose a cleaner commute - walk, bike or use mass transit instead of a car, especially during rush hour.<\/li>\n<li>Support policies that promote public transportation and energy conservation.<\/li>\n<li>Spend less time outdoors and in strenuous physical activity on poor air quality days. Avoid being outdoors in the middle of the day when pollution levels are highest.<\/li>\n<li>Know how sensitive you are to air pollution, and plan outdoor activities when and where pollution levels are lower.

Continuing and expanding these and other efforts at the State and Federal level can result in large benefits to the health of New York City residents.<\/p>","<h3>About Cockroaches<\/h3>\n<p>Cockroaches, or just \"roaches\", are a common urban pest. Though there are more than a thousand species of roaches, just a few are found in NYC homes.&nbsp; The most common are American Cockroaches, typically found in moist basements and lower floors, and German Cockroaches, found anywhere inside homes.<\/p>\n<p>Cockroaches like warm, dark places such as toasters, clocks, microwave ovens, walls, and cabinets.&nbsp; They need regular access to food and water to live and breed.<\/p>\n<p>This site provides survey data on the prevalence of cockroaches in NYC homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Cockroaches and Health<\/h3>\n<p>Besides causing annoyance and stress, roaches are sources of allergens that can trigger asthma symptoms in sensitized individuals. Cockroaches also contaminate food, and may contribute to food borne illnesses. The often indiscriminate use of hazardous chemicals to try to control cockroaches - especially from sprays, bombs and foggers - causes many cases of poisonings each year in NYC.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>Estimates of numbers and percentages of adults reporting cockroaches inside their residences are measured using surveys. The accuracy of survey data depends on the participants' ability to recall and correctly report sightings of cockroaches.<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>Simple steps can be taken to safely control these pests.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use caulk and plaster to seal holes and cracks in kitchen and bathroom walls, floors, ceilings and cabinets.<\/li>\n<li>Store food in sealed containers, and do not put out food for stray cats, pigeons or squirrels.<\/li>\n<li>Remove garbage daily from apartments, and put garbage on the curb as close to pickup time as possible. Use hard plastic or metal cans with tight fitting lids.<\/li>\n<li>Wash and dry dishes after each use.<\/li>\n<li>Use only safer pest control products such as boric acid, gels and baits for cockroaches. Apply boric acid where roaches are active (but away from children). Use behind cabinets, under refrigerators and in cracks and crevices before they are sealed. Place cockroach bait stations or apply gel bait in areas where you see roach droppings, egg cases, live or dead roaches.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid use of foggers, bombs and sprays. Never use products called \"Tempo\" or \"Roach Chalk\".<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>In 2003, adults in nearly 30% of NYC households (874,000 households) reported having cockroaches in their home.<br /><br />Tenants are entitled to safe and decent housing. All building owners are required by law to provide homes free of pests, and to employ maintenance practices that prevent and treat for the presence of roaches. Chemical-only approaches to pest control are generally insufficient to prevent and manage infestations. <br /><br />The Health Department offers detailed guides on how to safely prevent and manage pests in the home.<\/p>","<h3>About Neighborhood Air Quality<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Air quality can vary<\/strong> <strong>from neighborhood to neighborhood<\/strong>.

FDNE is defined as experiencing noise disruption three or more times per week.<\/p>\n<p>Like most cities in the United States, New York City (NYC) does not systematically monitor ambient noise or the prevalence of noise disturbance. However, the city tracks noise complaints through the NYC 311 call system and enforces the New York City Noise Code. 311 complaint data do not allow a full understanding of the burden of ambient noise because they may not capture information about all noise exposure; some New Yorkers are more likely to call about noise and some types of noise are most likely to generate a complaint. Thus, to gain a better understanding of noise disturbance among all New Yorkers, the Community Health Survey asked adults about how often they were disrupted by noise within the previous three months and about sources of disruptive noise.<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>To reduce environmental noise, one can consider the following methods:<\/p>\n<p>(a) Control at noise sources;<\/p>\n<p>It is often a primary consideration to reduce noise at its source. Whenever possible, quieter working methods or technologies should be used.<\/p>\n<p>(b) Noise reduction at the transmission path:<\/p>\n<p>An obvious way of reducing noise is to separate the sources of noise from noise sensitive uses. Options to avoid or minimize noise, say, through adopting alternative transport such as railway, pedestrian link, cycling path, underground roads can also be considered at the early planning stage.<\/p>\n<p>(c) Protection at the receiver end:<\/p>\n<p>By arranging noise sensitive uses such as bedrooms facing away from the noise sources or acoustic insulation by good glazing, the impact of noise on the receiver end can be reduced.<\/p>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;Ambient noise in the home, work or school often disrupts people&rsquo;s concentration. According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/\">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health<\/a>, ambient noise also affects people&rsquo;s health by increasing general stress levels and aggravating stress-related conditions such as high blood pressure, coronary disease, peptic ulcers and migraine headaches. Continued exposure does not lead to habituation; in fact, the effects worsen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/\">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health<\/a>&nbsp;offers detailed guides on noise and hearing loss prevention.<\/p>","<h3>About Cancer<\/h3>\n<p>Cancer is the general name for a group of more than 100 diseases in which cells in a part of the body begin to grow out of control. Cancers are named for the organ or type of cell in which they start.<\/p>\n<p>Cancer occurs at all ages, but the risk increases with age. One of every two men, and one of every three women, will be diagnosed with cancer at some time in their life. In women, breast is the most common type of cancer diagnosed. In men, prostate is the most common type of cancer diagnosed. For both men and women, lung cancers are the leading causes of death from cancer.<\/p>\n<p>In New York City cancer kills nearly 13,000 residents every year, with smoking as the leading cause. Most cancers develop slowly in people. Cancers with known environmental causes usually appear five to 40 years after exposure to a <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Carcinogen\" target=\"_blank\">carcinogen<\/a>. This long <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Latency_period\" target=\"_blank\">latency period<\/a> is one of the reasons it is difficult to determine what causes cancer.<\/p>\n<p>The data on this site comes from the <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#NYS_Cancer_Registry\" target=\"_blank\">NYS Cancer Registry<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Cancer and the Environment<\/h3>\n<p>Cancers have different causes and risk factors. Factors related to the occurrence of many types of cancer include age, sex, race, family history, smoking, diet, exercise and exposure to certain chemicals. Cancers often take a long time (decades) to develop, so it can be hard to single out a particular exposure as having a definite link to cancer.<br /><br />Environmental exposures that may increase the risk of cancer include asbestos and other inhalable fibers; ionizing radiation and chemicals found in the home, workplace, water, food and air.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>Data are reported over five-year time periods because the number of cases and rates for single years can vary considerably, particularly for less common types of cancer.<br /><br />All cancers diagnosed among NYS residents are required by law to be reported to the NYS Cancer Registry. The registry is considered to have 95% or higher case ascertainment.<br /><br />This site contains data on tobacco-related cancers of the mouth and throat area (<a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Larynx_Cancer\" target=\"_blank\">larynx<\/a>, <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Esophagus_Cancer\" target=\"_blank\"> esophagus<\/a>, oral cavity, and pharynx), cancers of the breast, lung and bronchus, pancreas, mesothelioma &ndash; a cancer associated with exposure to asbestos, bladder, brain and central nervous system, thyroid, kidney, liver, <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Non_Hodgkin_lymphoma\" target=\"_blank\">Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,<\/a> <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Leukemia\" target=\"_blank\">leukemia<\/a> and <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Melanoma\" target=\"_blank\">melanoma<\/a> skin cancer. These cancers were selected based on concern that environmental exposures could play a role in their development.<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>To reduce the risk of developing cancer or to detect cancer early:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quit smoking and encourage others to quit. Avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.<\/li>\n<li>Practice good nutrition (eating at least five servings of fresh fruit and vegetables daily).<\/li>\n<li>Support policies that increase access to healthy food and safe physical activity.<\/li>\n<li>Exercise regularly and maintain a healthy weight.<\/li>\n<li>Encourage or provide a work environment that supports physical activity by providing bike rooms and showers.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid use of and exposures to carcinogenic chemicals in the workplace.<\/li>\n<li>Use sun protection consistently to prevent skin cancers.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Detecting cancer early saves lives. Get screened at appropriate ages for cervical, breast and colon and rectal cancer.&nbsp;<\/p>","<h3>About Sugary Drinks<\/h3>\n<p>Sugary drinks contribute to a higher-calorie diet, long-term weight gain, and increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. Sugary drinks provide little or no nutritional value, and because they don&rsquo;t fill you up the way food does, you end up consuming more calories. Also, food and beverage portion sizes have exploded over the past several decades, and studies have shown that when given larger portions, people consume more without recognizing it.<\/p>\n<h3>Sugary Drinks and Health<\/h3>\n<p>Obesity is at epidemic proportions in New York City. More than half of New York City adults (58%) are overweight or obese; nearly 40% of New York City&rsquo;s public school students (K-8) are obese or overweight; and the percentage of adults with diagnosed diabetes is increasing, with nearly 10% of New Yorkers now diagnosed with diabetes.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>Sugary drink consumption indicators presented on this site are derived from the annual NYC Youth Risk Behavior Surveys and the Community Health Surveys. They are estimates that depend on study participants' accurate recollections and reporting.<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>Make healthier choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drink plenty of water; nothing quenches thirst better than water.<\/li>\n<li>Choose fat-free or 1% milk.<\/li>\n<li>Switch from juice to whole fruit; whole fruit has fewer calories, and unlike juice, it has fiber.<\/li>\n<li>Skip sports drinks and energy drinks; most are high in sugar and low in nutrients, and energy drinks are loaded with caffeine.<\/li>\n<li>Pass on the high-calorie sweetened coffee and tea drinks; instead, order your coffee or tea plain and lightly flavor it yourself.<\/li>\n<li>Choose smaller portions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>Sugary drinks are a major contributor to obesity &ndash; and obesity is a risk factor for heart disease and diabetes.<br /><br />Residents of poor neighborhoods consume more sugary drinks than residents of wealthier neighborhoods. <br /><br />There are numerous healthy alternatives to sugary drinks, such as water, seltzer, fat-free or 1% milk, and unsweetened tea.<\/p>","<h3 id=\"descriptiontitle\">About Heart Attacks<\/h3>\n<p>A heart attack is referred to medically as an acute myocardial infarction. It is caused when the blood flow that brings oxygen to the heart is severely reduced or cut off altogether. Without adequate blood flow, heart cells can quickly become injured or die. Most heart attacks are an acute event that follows years of atherosclerosis - a build up of plaque in the arteries around the heart. Factors in the environment may contribute to both atherosclerosis and to the acute event itself.<\/p>\n<p>This site provides data on hospitalizations for heart attack.<\/p>\n<h3>Heart Attacks and the Environment<\/h3>\n<p>Genetics, lifestyle and environmental factors can all contribute to an increased risk for heart attack. In addition to lifestyle risk factors such as high LDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity and diabetes, exposure to certain <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Air_Pollutant\" target=\"_blank\">ambient air pollutants<\/a> can also increase the risk of a heart attack. Most ambient air pollutants originate from fossil fuel (e.g. diesel, gasoline, fuel oil and coal) combustion.<br /><br />Second-hand smoke is the single largest contributor to indoor air pollution. Studies suggest that exposure to second-hand smoke can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>The data presented on this site only include people who have been hospitalized for heart attack, and do not include those who died before admission or who were treated outside of the hospital.<br /><br />Differences in heart attack hospitalization rates could reflect differences in diagnostic techniques, <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Disease_Coding_Practices\" target=\"_blank\">disease coding practices<\/a> and factors that affect the likelihood of being hospitalized for heart attack, such as access to medical care.<br /><br />Data show the number of heart attack hospitalizations rather than the number of people hospitalized. For example, if a person was hospitalized twice, they would be counted twice.<br /><br />Heart attack hospitalizations are being tracked to fill the need for a national, centralized surveillance system for this important disease. Tracking heart attack hospitalizations can help to examine trends, identify populations at risk and facilitate research.<\/p>\n<h3>Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>To reduce the risk of heart attacks, individuals, health care providers and public agencies can promote these actions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Health care providers should counsel all patients on how to modify their diets, exposures and lifestyles to prevent cardiovascular diseases.<\/li>\n<li>Everyone should \"Know Your Number\" - blood pressure and cholesterol levels. These should be checked at every regular doctor visit. Many local pharmacies now offer free blood pressure checks.<\/li>\n<li>Quit smoking to reduce your risk of a heart attack. Smokers are two to six times more likely to die of a heart attack than nonsmokers.<\/li>\n<li>Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and choose foods low in sodium and saturated fat, and without added sugars. Neighborhoods can work together to increase access to healthy foods by promoting green markets, and encouraging neighborhood stores to carry fresh fruits and vegetables.<\/li>\n<li>Support policies that limit smoking in public places and improve air quality.<\/li>\n<li>Call 911 right away if you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, because early treatment can save lives and prevent disability.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death, regardless of race or ethnicity for both men and women in NYC and nationwide. Heart attacks cause almost 3,000 deaths in NYC each year.&nbsp; Over 12,000 hospitalizations for heart attacks occurred among NYC residents in 2007. <br /><br />Of the five boroughs, Staten Island has the highest age-adjusted hospitalization rate for heart attacks.<\/p>","<h3>About Asthma<\/h3>\n<p>Asthma is a <strong>common disease in which the lungs become swollen, making breathing difficult<\/strong>.

Because the New York City emits nearly 0.25% of the world's total GHGs, decreasing our emissions and becoming more efficient will have a positive impact.<\/p>\n<h3>Climate Change and Health<\/h3>\n<p>Climate change can affect human health in many ways. For NYC, the two main climate change-related health risks are <strong>heat stress<\/strong> from increased number and intensity of heat waves, and <strong>health impacts from coastal storms<\/strong>. These impacts can affect the health of all New Yorkers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>To Reduce Health Risks<\/h3>\n<p>NYC has been responding to climate change and is working to improve the city's resilience against future climate change. To help reduce health risks related to climate change, you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Support policies that reduce GHGs<\/strong>, including improving public transportation, reducing waste, promoting energy efficiency and producing food and consumer goods locally.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Join a community group that focuses on climate change<\/strong>, and create or participate in community-based action plans that reduce health risks such as using buddy systems during <a title=\"Extreme heat and your health\" href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/emergency-preparedness/emergencies-extreme-weather-heat.page\">heat waves<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","<h3 id=\"descriptiontitle\">About Carbon Monoxide<\/h3>\n<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a poisonous gas that forms when fuel or other materials are burned.&nbsp; It is invisible and has no odor.&nbsp; Even short-term exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide can be fatal.<\/p>\n<p>This site contains data on unintentional carbon monoxide incidents and emergency responses by the <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/html/home2.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">New York City Fire Department (FDNY)<\/a>, reports to the <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/poison-control.page\" target=\"_blank\">NYC Poison Control Center (PCC)<\/a> of actual or potential carbon monoxide exposure and hospitalizations of NYC residents who have been poisoned by carbon monoxide.<\/p>\n<h3>Carbon Monoxide and Health<\/h3>\n<p>Carbon monoxide exerts its toxic effects by blocking oxygen transport in the body.&nbsp; Breathing high concentrations of carbon monoxide can cause loss of consciousness, permanent neurological injury or death. <br /><br />Symptoms of mild carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness and disorientation.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Data and Indicators<\/h3>\n<p>The frequency of carbon monoxide poisonings that occur in New York City may be underestimated in these data for several reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Symptoms of mild to moderate carbon monoxide poisoning are non-specific, and may be confused with flu-like illness.<\/li>\n<li>Persons experiencing these symptoms may not seek medical treatment or call the Poison Control Center.<\/li>\n<li>Though all poisonings are reportable to the Department of Health, many health care providers may neglect to do so.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Prevention<br />To help prevent carbon monoxide poisoning:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Residential property owners are required by NYC law to install and maintain smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Make sure your home has working detectors that can be heard from any bedroom. Test your detectors and replace their batteries at least twice a year. Never remove the batteries to use in another device, even for a short time.<\/li>\n<li>Never use a gas stove, oven or other cooking appliance to heat your home.&nbsp; And never use unvented gas space heaters - they're illegal.&nbsp; Tenants should call 311 to report heating problems that landlords fail to repair. Home owners should have heating systems inspected before each winter season.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>If using an emergency generator when the power goes out, never run it indoors or near any enclosed space. Keep it outside, far away from any doors or windows.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid carbon monoxide hazards around motor vehicles. On cold days, check to make sure the tail pipe under the vehicle is clear of snow before starting the engine, and never warm up a car inside a garage.&nbsp; Never swim or do water sports close to the exhaust outlet on a boat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Key Messages<\/h3>\n<p>Nationally and locally, the rates of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning have slowly declined over the past three decades.&nbsp; However, carbon monoxide remains a common cause of life-threatening and fatal poisonings. From 2000 to 2005, more than 400 New York City residents were hospitalized and 30 died as a result of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning.<br /><br />In 2004, NYC became one of the first major cities to require carbon monoxide detectors in residential buildings. Since the NYC carbon monoxide detector law was enacted, there has been a five-fold increase in the number of carbon monoxide incidents detected by a working alarm in the home.<\/p>","<h3  id=\"descriptiontitle\">Brownfields <\/h3 ><p><a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/home/home.shtml\" title=\"PlaNYC Home Page\">PlaNYC<\/a> is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York City's future. <p><p>Goal: Clean up all contaminated land in the city.<p><p> \r\n\r\nBrownfields are defined as vacant commercial or industrial properties that remain undeveloped because of real or perceived contamination that may complicate redevelopment.

As part of its efforts, OER has developed a Vacant Property Database (VPD)  to help developers identify vacant commercial and industrial properties that may be available for redevelopment, and to provide basic data on past property usage and environmental features. As of 2011, NYC had between 1500 and 2000 potential brownfields, based on a review of vacant properties, historic filling patterns, and other environmental features in the VPD.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe VPD assesses potential or actual contamination on vacant properties, which are only a fraction of the total property stock in NYC. Thus, new brownfield sites will continue to emerge as buildings reach the end of their use cycle and are rebuilt. Our target is to ultimately reduce the number of brownfields in NYC to zero.<br><br><h3  >Brownfield Site Remediation<\/h3 ><br>The PlaNYC goal is to provide the necessary resources to enable brownfields to be redeveloped as easily - or more easily -  than equivalent non-contaminated properties.

There is some evidence that&nbsp; <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Prenatal_exposure\" target=\"_blank\">prenatal exposure<\/a> to air pollution (particulate matter and other pollutants), lead, pesticides and solvents increases the likelihood that a pregnancy results in an adverse outcome. <br /><br /><\/p><p><h3 >About the Data and Indicators<\/h3 ><br />We restricted our data to births (and infant deaths) occurring in NYC to mothers whose usual residence is NYC. The mother's usual residence is recorded on the baby's birth certificate.<br /><br />We use the physician's clinical estimate of gestation to identify preterm births.<br /><br />We use very low birth weight (&lt; 3 lbs, 5 oz) as an indicator of preterm birth, because most very low birth weight babies are born preterm.<br /><br />We use low birth weight (&lt; 5 lbs, 8 oz) among pregnancies that reach term (at least 37 weeks) as an indicator of \"growth retardation\". Restricting to term pregnancies removes the majority of low birth weight babies who are small because they were born preterm and did not have time to finish growing before birth. <br /><br />Historically, the ratio of male to female births has been about 1.05. Some have hypothesized that exposure to certain chemicals in the environment can reduce the number of male births, so sex ratio may be a useful environmental public health indicator.<br /><br />Total (lifetime) fertility rate is the expected number of births to a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 women experiencing the current age-specific birth rates among NYC women. Measures of childbirth are only crude indicators of fertility since the decision to have children is dependent on many behavioral and social customs.<br /><br />Our tracking indicators differ from those presented by the NYC Bureau of Vital Statistics.

Nationwide, lead poisoning is associated with housing constructed before 1950, when lead-based paint was widely used and contained more lead than in later decades. In 1960, NYC banned the use of lead-based paint in homes and a national ban went into effect in 1978. Older layers of lead paint may still be present in older buildings and can become a lead hazard when the paint chips, peels or is abraded, or when renovations or repairs are conducted without taking appropriate actions to control dust. Families residing in older, poorly maintained housing are at higher risk for lead poisoning.<\/p>\n<p>Dust from lead-based paint can contaminate floors and windowsills, and children's hands, and toys. Young children who crawl on the floor and put their hands and toys in their mouths are at greatest risk for lead poisoning through swallowing lead dust.<\/p>\n<p>Lead from sources other than paint may also present a hazard to children.
