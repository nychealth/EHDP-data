This prototype is a static site built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Generally, Hugo works by combining content (written in markdown) with templates (HTML) to produce the site's HTML files. 

This site has four main sections:
- Data Stories: pages with narrative content and data visualizations
- Key Topics: pages that ingest content from across the site
- Neighborhood Reports: pages that read JSON and CSV data to generate neighborhood reports about health topics
- Data Explorer: pages that read JSON and CSV data to generate visualizations of datasets
